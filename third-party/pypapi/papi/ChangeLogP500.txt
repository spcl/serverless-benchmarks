  * 4b4f87ff ChangeLogP5000.txt: Changelog for PAPI5

  * 6f208c06 doc/Doxyfile-common papi.spec src/Makefile.in...: Bump version
  numbers in prep for a 5.0 release.

  * c6fdbd11 release_procedure.txt: Update release_procedure.txt  Change the
  order of when we branch git, so that the main dev branch gets some of the
  release related changes.

2012-04-17  

  * 97d4687f ChangeLogP440.txt: Pickup the changelog from papi 4.4  This was
  only included in the stable-4.4 branch.

2012-08-23  

  * 628c2b6e src/buildbot_configure_with_components.sh: Take debug out of the
  with several components build test config.  When built with PAPI's memory
  wrapper routines, the threaded stress tests will sometimes get into poor
  performing situations.  See trac ticket 148 for discussion.

2012-08-22  

  * 46faae8e src/ctests/overflow2.c src/ctests/overflow_single_event.c
  src/ctests/overflow_twoevents.c...: Move find_nonderived_event() from
  overflow_twoevents to test_utils and call it from overflow2 and
  overflow_single_event to insure that we're not trying to overflow on a
  derived event.

  * 3e7d8455 src/ctests/zero_smp.c: Fix a memory leak reported on the aix
  power7 machine.  zero_smp.c did not unregister at the end of its thread
  function.

  * 3ad5782f src/perf_events.c: perf_events: fix segfault if DEBUG is enabled
  Was incorrectly using "i" as an index where it should be "0" in a debug
  statement.


2012-08-21  

  * a3cadbdb src/ftests/accum.F src/ftests/avail.F src/ftests/case1.F...: Take
  #2. Changing len_trim function in ftests to last_char. This time, I respect
  72 char line limit.

  * c9db8fbf src/ctests/overflow_force_software.c: overflow_force_software was
  the only test that used a different hard_tolerance value (0.25) than the
  other overflow tests (0.75). This caused trouble on Power7/AIX. Now we are
  using the same hard_tolerance value in all overflow tests.

  * 70515343 src/ftests/accum.F src/ftests/avail.F src/ftests/case1.F...:
  Changed name of function len_trim to last_char.

  * 95168d79 src/components/cuda/linux-cuda.c: Cleanup cuda shutdown code.
  * The
  shutdown_thread code cleaned out the whole component's state. This has been
  split into shutdown_global for the whole component, and shutdown_thread is
  left to cleanup some control state info.

  * 56284f81 src/ctests/multiplex1_pthreads.c: Fix memory leaks in pthread
  multiplex tests.

  * aeead8b6 src/threads.c: Remove an outdated comment about
  _papi_hwi_free_EventSet holding INTERNAL lock

  * e598647b src/perf_events.c: perf_events: fix issue where we dereference a
  pointer before NULL check.  Fix suggested by Will Cohen, based on a coverity
  report.

  * 4e0ed976 src/ctests/calibrate.c: Modify warning message to eliminate the
  word "error" Hopefully this will suppress it in buildbot outputs.

  * 50fbba18 src/ctests/api.c src/ftests/case2.F: Cleanup a few more warnings
  from the PAPI_perror change.

  * 1f06bf28 src/ftests/case2.F: Missed an instance of perror in the fortran
  code.

  * 93e6ae2c src/ftests/ftests_util.F: Fix warning in ftest_util.F

2012-08-20  

  * 60c6029e src/perf_events.c: perf_events: Update multiplexing code  It
  * turns
  out the PERF_EVENT_IOC_RESET ioctl resets the count but not the multiplexing
  info.  This means that when we fiddle with the events then reset them in
  check_scheduability(), we are not really resetting things to zero.  The
  effect might be small, but since the new multiplex code by definition is
  always scheduable, then let's skip the test if multiplexing.

  * 9079236c src/ctests/zero.c: Change error reporting so FLOPS > 100% above
  theoretical FAIL and FLOPS > 25% above theoretical WARN.

2012-08-18  

  * 980558af src/papi_internal.c: papi_internal: fix memory leak  When I made
  some changes a while back I forgot to free ESI->NativeBits properly.  This
  was causing memory leak warnings on buildbot.

2012-08-17  

  * 83a14612 src/perf_events.c: perf_events: more cleanups and comments  We
  really need to go back and figure out in more detail what the
  profile/sampling/overflow code is doing.

  * 7cafb941 src/perf_events.c: perf_events: more cleanups and comments

  * e9e39a4b src/perf_events.c: perf_events: disable kernel multiplexing
  * before
  2.6.34  It turns out even our simple multiplexing won't work on kernels
  before 2.6.34, so fall back to sw multiplex in that case.

  * 05801901 src/perf_events.c: perf_events: more cleanup and comments

  * 268e31d7 src/perf_events.c: perf_events: more cleanup and commenting

  * d62fc2bf src/perf_events.c: perf_events: more cleanup and comments

  * fb0081bc src/perf_events.c: perf_events: more cleanups and comments

  * a1142fc8 src/perf_events.c: perf_events: cleanup and comment the kernel
  * bug
  workarounds

  * b8560369 src/perf_events.c: perf_events: minor cleanups and new comments

  * 6c320bb2 src/perf_events.c: perf_events: fix some debug messages  I forget
  to test with --with-debug enabled

  * f7a3cccf src/perf_events.c: perf_events: enable new read_code  This makes
  the read code much simpler.  It finishes the multiplexing changes.  To avoid
  complication, we no longer enable PERF_FORMAT_ID as reading that extra info
  is unnecessary with the current implementation.  This passes all the tests
on
  a recent kernel, but on 2.6.32 there are still a few issues.

  * 15749cff src/ctests/all_events.c src/ctests/all_native_events.c: Fix
  warning in all_events and all_native_events.  In the perror semantic change,
  several strings for use in the old interface were left.

2012-08-16  

  * afdd25fa src/perf_events.c: perf_events: always enable kernel multiplexing
  The new code should work on any kernel version.

  * 9f5e23ae src/perf_events.c: Rewrite multiplex support.  Drop support for
  the former "partitioned" multiplexing, as we could never use it.  Instead
use
  the simple/braindead model.  This still needs more work, as sometimes reads
  are failing.

  * cdd29909 src/ftests/strtest.F: Fix strtest.F ftest  It was still making
  some assumptions about PAPI_perror() writing to a string rather than
directly
  to standard error.

  * 565f60b3 src/papi_internal.c: Missing code to set num_error_chunks to 0
  The new _papi_hwi_cleanup_errors() function was not resetting
  num_error_chunks to 0, leading to a segfault in the fmultiplex1 test.

2012-08-02  

  * bb85bafd src/genpapifdef.c src/papi.c src/papi_common_strings.h...: Remove
  usage of _papi_hwi_err.  Move PAPI over to storing errors in a runtime list.
  * Functions to add/lookup errors. * Generate the list of PAPI_E* errors at
  library_init time. * genpapifdef pulled the values for the PAPI_* error
  return codes from the _papi_hwi_err structure at configure time. Since this
  is now built at run-time, I added the appropriate values to genpapifdef's
  builting describe_t table. See : _papi_hwi_publish_error
  _papi_hwi_init_errors For usage hints.

2012-08-10  

  * e27af085 src/perf_events.c: perf_event: rename BRAINDEAD_MULTIPLEXING  It
  is now "simple_multiplexing" and is a variable not an #ifdef  This is needed
  before perf_event multiplexing can be sorted out.  It's unclear if it
  actually works anyway.

  * 7f8e8c58 src/perf_events.c: perf_event: remove context "cookie" field  It
  was a bit of overkill, we just need an initialized field. Also revamp how
  context and control are initialized.

  * 8cb8ac6d src/perf_events.c: perf_event: move all event specific info to
  * the
  control state  previously half was in the context state and half in the
  control state  perf_event has a strange architecture with each event being
  created having its own fd, which is context wide.  In PAPI though we usually
  only have one eventset (control state) active at once, so there's no need to
  have the context be aware of this.

2012-08-09  

  * 8d7782cb src/perf_events.c: perf_event: rename evt_t to perf_event_info_t
  This just makes the code easier to follow.

  * 349de05c src/perf_events.c: perf_event: remove the superfluous
  per_event_info_t structure

2012-08-08  

  * da8ad0a2 src/ctests/all_native_events.c src/ctests/get_event_component.c
  src/utils/native_avail.c: Fix warnings about PAPI_enum_cmp_event() return
not
  being checked  Reported by coverity checker via Will Cohen  Harmless
  warnings, and now the checker will likely complain about the value being
  checked but ignored.

  * b4719888 src/papi_user_events.c: Fix unused value in papi_user_events.c
  Reported by Coverity checker by Will Cohen

  * 6a8f255c src/utils/event_chooser.c: remove unused
  * PAPI_get_component_info()
  call in event_chooser  Reported by Will Cohen from coverity checker

2012-08-06  

  * 62cda478 src/genpapifdef.c src/papi_common_strings.h
  src/papi_internal.c...: Remove usage of _papi_hwi_err.  genpapifdef pulled
  the values for the PAPI_* error return codes from the _papi_hwi_err structure
  at configure time. Since this is now built at run-time, I added the
  appropriate values to genpapifdef's builting describe_t table.

2012-08-02  

  * d11259f3 src/papi.c src/papi_internal.c src/papi_internal.h...: Move over
  to generating the list of PAPI errors at library_init time.

  * 097ffc44 src/papi_internal.c: Functions to add/lookup errors.

2012-08-07  

  * 2530533f src/papi_events.csv: tests/zero fails on Power7 due to PAPI_FP_INS
  Error of 50%. Preset definition has been redefined and test now passes.

  * 8e17836f src/components/appio/Rules.appio src/components/appio/appio.c
  src/components/appio/appio.h...: We now intercept recv(). The support for
  recv() requires dynamic linkage. For static linkage, recv is not intercepted.

2012-08-06  

  * 8b1eb84c src/perf_events.c: perf_events: some whitespace cleanup and extra
  comments

  * f10edba6 src/perf_events.c: perf_events: MAX_READ was no longer being used,
  remove it

  * 08c06ed1 src/perf_events.c: perf_event event_id is actually 64-bit, so make
  our copy match

  * a33e8d9c src/perf_events.c: Rename context_t pe_context_t in perf_events.c 
  Makes the code a bit clearer and matches how other components name things.

  * 96ce9dcd src/perf_events.c: Rename control_state_t pe_control_state_t  This
  makes the code a bit easier to follow and matches how other components name
  things.

2012-08-03  

  * 4c5dce7f src/ctests/zero.c: Beef up error reporting.

  * 83b5d28a src/ctests/cycle_ratio.c: Have the cycle_ratio test skip if
  PAPI_REF_CYC event is not defined.

2012-08-02  

  * 25b1ba41 src/ctests/cycle_ratio.c: Removed all TESTS_QUIET blocks. They
  aren't needed because tests_quiet() overloads printf. We should probably
  remove TEST_QUIET blocks in ALL tests at some point for code clarity…

  * 8777d7d4 src/ctests/zero.c: Fixed error reporting. The error computation
  was inside a TESTS_QUIET block and wasn't getting executed when run quietly.
  Thus this test always passed on buildbot, even when it didn't.

  * 006fe8e9 src/ctests/Makefile: Fix typo in cycle_ratio make line.

  * 88e6d6a4 src/aix.c src/aix.h: Setting number of multiplex counters back to
  32 for AIX. Before it was set equal to number of max HW counters. This caused
  ctests/sdsc-mpx to fail.

  * ab78deda src/papi_events.csv: ctests/calibrate on Power7/AIX failed with a
  50% error all the way through. Updated the preset FP_OPS with a more
  appropriate definition. Now the calibrate errors range from 0.0002 to 0.0011%
  for double and single precision

  * fadce32f src/ctests/calibrate.c: Modify calibrate test in two ways: 1. add
  a -f flag to suppress failures and allow test to run to completion; 2. change
  error detection to allow warnings above MAX_WARN and failures above MAX_FAIL.
  Currently set to 10% and 80% respectively. This allows speculative over
  counting to pass with warning rather than fail completely.

  * 8a39ac9d src/papi_events.csv: LST_INS for Power7 was defined from 3 native
  events that cannot be counted together at the same time. Caused
  ctests/all_events to fail. Updated the preset with a more appropriate
  definition.

  * cdc16e5d src/papi_events.csv: L1_DCA for Power7 was defined from 3 native
  events that cannot be counted together at the same time. That caused
  ctests/tenth to fail. Updated the preset with a more appropriate definition.

2012-08-01  

  * 2bf44d13 src/papi_internal.c src/perf_events.c: icc does not like
  arithmetic on void pointers. Added cast to unsigned char* when arithmetic was
  being performed on void pointers in papi_internal and perf_events.

  * 7825ec14 src/ctests/api.c src/ctests/attach2.c src/ctests/attach3.c...:
  Modify tests that FAIL if PAPI_FP_OPS or PAPI_FP_INS not implemented. Now
  they will warn and continue. This is specifically to accommodate the
  brain-dead IvyBridge implementation.

  * fd70a015 src/testlib/test_utils.c: Re-writing of test_utils introduced new
  bugs that caused ctests/tenth to fail. test_events struct lists the same
  event twice (MASK_L1_DCW), hence PAPI_add_event() fails because it's forced
  to add the same preset twice.

  * 74ece3a0 src/run_tests.sh: run_tests.sh was clobbering $EXCLUDE variable if
  $CUDA was defined. Changed to add entries from run_tests_exclude_cuda.txt to
  $EXCLUDE which should already contain entries from run_tests_exclude.txt
  instead of replacing the entries already contained.

  * 11ed2364 src/libpfm4/config.mk: Added check in libpfm4/config.mk to check
  if using icc. If so, the -Wno-unused-parameter flag will no longer be used
  because icc does not provide it and provides no alternative.

  * dedf73f6 src/papi_user_events.c: fget() returns an int it should be treated
  as an int  The coverity scan flagged that the int return by fget was stored
  in a char. The main concern with this is the EOF that fget() could return is
  -1. Do not want to mess up that value by typecasting to char and then back to
  int. 

  * c4fcbe7e src/ctests/kufrin.c: Check return values of PAPI_get_cmp_opt() and
  calloc  A coverity scan showed that PAPI_get_cmp_opt() could potentially
  return a negative number.  Also it is good form to check the return value of
  calloc to ensure it is a non-null pointer. 

  * e89d6ffa src/testlib/test_utils.c: Clean up test_print_event_header() 
  There were a couple warnings flagged by coverity on
  test_print_events_header(). The function now checks for error conditions
  flagged by PAPI_get_cmp_opt() and also frees memory allocated by a calloc()
  function. 

  * c81d8b60 src/threads.h: Eliminate deadcode from threads.h  If
  HAVE_THREAD_LOCAL_STORAGE is defined, a portion of the
  _papi_hwi_lookup_thread() will never be executed.  This patch make either one
  section or the other section of code be compiled.  This will eliminate a
  coverity scan warning about unreachable code. 

  * f70f3f56 src/ctests/all_native_events.c: Eliminate unused variable in
  ctests/all_native_events.c  Coverity identified a variable that was set but
  never used in all_native_events.c.  This patch removes the unused variable to
  eliminate that warning. 

  * a9f29840 src/components/appio/appio.c: A couple places in appio.c used the
  FD_SET() without initializing the variable. Coverity scan pointed out this
  issue. 

  * 9e535ae2 src/components/rapl/linux-rapl.c: A Coverity scan pointed out that
  read_msr() could potentially use an invalid value of fd for pread().  Need to
  check the value of fd before using it. 

  * 7b55c675 src/components/rapl/linux-rapl.c: The arrays used for
  initialization were hard coded to 1024 packages. Want to avoid hard coding
  that so the day when machines with 1025 packages are available is a
  non-event.  Also changed the initialization code to avoid having the
  initialization be O((number of packages)^2) in time complexity. 

2012-07-27  

  * 3703995a src/papi_internal.c: Fix the component name predending code.  When
  presented with a NULL component .short_name, the code did the wrong thing.

  * 5258db8b src/components/cuda/linux-cuda.c: Fix a warning in cuda.

2012-07-26  

  * ddd6f193 src/ctests/Makefile src/ctests/cycle_ratio.c: Add a test to
  compute nominal CPU MHz from real cycles and use PAPI_TOT_CYC and
  PAPI_REF_CYC to compute effective MHz. Warns if PAPI_REF_CYC is zero, which
  can happen on kernels < ~3.3.

  * fab5e9ef src/papiStdEventDefs.h src/papi_common_strings.h
  src/papi_events.csv: Add PAPI_REF_CYC preset event. Define it as
  UNHALTED_REFERENCE_CYCLES for all Intel platforms on which this native event
  is supported.

2012-07-25  

  * 8b9b6bef src/papi_events.csv: Modify SandyBridge and IvyBridge tables:
  SandyBridge FP_OPS only counts scalars; SP_OPS and DP_OPS now count
  correctly, including SSE and AVX. IvyBridge can't count FP at all;
  adjustments made to eliminate event differences with SandyBridge.

2012-07-26  

  * 5b11c982 src/components/cuda/linux-cuda.c: Fix the cuda component.  The
  cuda component prepended CUDA. to all its event names, this is no longer the
  case.

2012-07-25  

  * db5b0857 src/papi_events.csv: Added 2 new preset definitions for BGQ. Note,
  these presets use the new feature where a generic event mask together with an
  ORed opcode string is used. This won't work until the new Q driver is
  released (currently scheduled for end of August).

2012-07-24  

  * af7cd721 src/components/coretemp/linux-coretemp.c
  src/components/coretemp/tests/coretemp_pretty.c
  src/components/cuda/linux-cuda.c...: Enforce all our components to use the
  same naming.  We setteled on :'s as inter-event seperators. This also touches
  a few of the components' tests, we changed the name field so their searches
  needed help.

2012-07-23  

  * 57aeb9d4 src/papi_internal.c: Prepend component .short_name to each event
  name.  Use ::: as a sep.

2012-07-24  

  * 762e9584 src/ctests/multiplex2.c src/sw_multiplex.c: Fix multiplex2 test 
  It complained if it tried to add a multiplex event and PAPI properly told it
  that it couldn't.

  * 531870f1 src/papi_internal.c: Add sanity check at component init time 
  Looks for num_cntrs being larger than num_mpx_cntrs which doesn't make much
  sense.

  * 53ad0259 src/extras.c src/genpapifdef.c src/papi.c...: Rename
  PAPI_MAX_HWCTRS to PAPI_EVENTS_IN_DERIVED_EVENT  Hopefully this will make
  things a little less confusing.

  * 700af24b src/papi_internal.c: Change EventInfoArrayLength to always return
  num_mpx_cntrs  Things should be consistently using num_mpx_cntrs rather than
  num_cntrs now.  Issue reported by Steve Kaufmann

  * d1570bec src/sw_multiplex.c: Fix sw_multiplex bug when max SW counters is
  less than max HW counters  this was causing kufrin and max_multiplex to fail

  * f47f5d6a src/aix.c src/components/appio/appio.c
  src/components/bgpm/CNKunit/linux-CNKunit.c...: Remove PAPI_MPX_DEF_DEG  It
  was not well documented and being used in confused ways all over the code. 
  Now there is a different define PAPI_MAX_SW_MPX_EVENTS used by the software
  multiplex code.  All other components have had the value replaced with just
  the maximum number of counters.  If a component can handle its own
  (non-software) multiplexing it is up to it to set .num_mpx_cntrs to a value
  that's different from .num_cntrs

  * 0d83f5db src/papi_internal.c src/papi_internal.h: Split NativeBits off of
  NativeInfoArray in EventSet  previously we were doing some crazy thing where
  we allocated both at once and then split them afterward.  The new code is
  easier to follow.

  * 98f2ecbd src/papi_internal.c: Clean up EventSet creation  Sort out which
  sizes are used for allocating which structures.

  * e1024579 src/Makefile.inc src/multiplex.c src/multiplex.h...: Rename the
  multiplex files to be sw_multiplex  That way it's more clear the stuff
  included only relates to software multiplexing, not generic multiplexing.

  * a6adc7ff src/multiplex.h src/papi_internal.c src/papi_internal.h: Move some
  sw-multiplex specific terms out of papi_internal.h and into multiplex.h

2012-07-23  

  * 1ddbe117 src/components/README: Added note that lmsensors component
  requires lmsensors version >=3.0.0

  * 94676869 src/components/appio/appio.c
  src/components/appio/tests/appio_test_pthreads.c: proper checking of return
  codes in response to tests using coverity

  * ea958b18 src/components/appio/tests/appio_list_events.c
  src/components/appio/tests/appio_values_by_code.c: As component name in table
  has been changed from appio.c to appio, we now use appio in the tests.

2012-07-20  

  * f212cc34 src/components/appio/appio.c
  src/components/coretemp/linux-coretemp.c
  src/components/coretemp_freebsd/coretemp_freebsd.c...: Add .short_name
  entries to each component.

  * 1e755836 src/papi_libpfm4_events.c src/perf_events.c: Fix use-after-free
  bug in perf_events.c  This turned up in the ctests/flops test, and Valgrind
  made it easy to track down.

  * 4580ed1d src/perf_events.c: Update perf_event.c rdpmc support  Use the
  libpfm4 definition for mmap rather than our custom one, now that libpfm4 has
  been updated

  * 47558b2c src/libpfm4/examples/showevtinfo.c
  src/libpfm4/include/perfmon/perf_event.h
  src/libpfm4/lib/pfmlib_intel_nhm_unc.c...: Import current libpfm4 from
  libpfm4 git  It has some minor uncore fixes plus the header changes needed
  for rdpmc.

2012-07-17  

  * 65d4c06c src/linux-common.c: Reorder statements to ensure the fclose() are
  performed  Coverity pointed out that it was possible for resources to be
  leaked in linux-common.c if the fscanf() encountered error.  This reordering
  of the statements ensures that the fclose() calls are done regards of the
  results of the fscanf() functions. 

2012-07-18  

  * 7bf071ff src/papi_user_events.c: Ensure that load_user_event_table() frees
  files and memory on error  A Coverity scan showed that an error condition in
  load_user_event_table() function would exit the the function without closing
  the table file or freeing allocated memory.  This patch addresses those
  issues. 

2012-07-17  

  * 1ba52e35 src/components/stealtime/linux-stealtime.c: Ensure that
  read_stealtime() closes the file in case of an error condition  A Coverity
  scan showed that an error condition could cause read_stealtime() to exit
  without closing the file.  This patch ensures that the file is closed
  regardless of success or failure. 

2012-07-18  

  * f37f22e5 src/papi_libpfm4_events.c: Fix warning in papi_libpfm4_events.c 
  We were setting a value but never using it.

  * 8e8401bc src/testlib/test_utils.c: Remove unused variable in test_utils.c 
  Most of the machines in buildbot were complaining about this.

  * 133ce6a9 src/linux-timer.c: Add missing papi_vector.h include to
  linux-timer.c  This was breaking on PPC Linux

2012-07-17  

  * 6fd3cedd src/perf_events.c: Fix perf_events.c warnings reported by ICC

  * 21c8f932 src/perfctr-x86.c: Fix perfctr-x86 build with debug enabled

  * 08f76743 src/configure src/configure.in src/linux-bgq.c: Attempt to fix
  linux-bgq compilation error.  It turns out BGQ uses the standard
  linux-context.h header

  * 43457f4f src/linux-bgq.c: Made check for opcodes more robust.

  * d58116b4 src/perf_events.c: More cleanups of perf_events.c file

  * 409438b7 src/freebsd-context.h src/freebsd.c src/freebsd.h: Fix FreeBSD
  compile warnings  Similar to the perfctr issues.

  * 1e6dfb02 src/aix.c src/aix.h: Fix AIX build warnings  They were similar in
  cause to the perfctr issues.

  * 3d0b5785 src/Rules.perfmon2 src/components/appio/appio.c
  src/components/bgpm/CNKunit/linux-CNKunit.h...: Remove papi_vector.h include
  from papi_internal.h  There were some semi-circular dependencies that came up
  with the context split changes.  The easiest way to fix things for perfctr
  was just move papi_vector.h out to be included explicitly.  This touches a
  lot of files because a lot of files include papi_internal.h  This should also
  fix the perfctr and perfmon2 builds that were broken yesterday.

2012-07-16  

  * a7a14a5b src/ctests/zero.c src/testlib/test_utils.c: Modify zero test to
  warm up processor before measuring events, and report timing errors as signed
  deviations. Modify test_utils add_two_events code to check for errors after
  adding nominally valid events. This is a more rigorous test than just
  counting available registers.

  * de0860d3 src/perf_events.c: Remove perf_events.h module header  It's no
  longer needed, everything important is merged into the perf_events.c file.

  * 22975f14 src/perf_events.c: Remove perf_event SYNCHRONIZED_RESET code  This
  was never defined and never used, just remove the code.

  * 48750b8c src/perf_events.c: Remove papi_pe_allocate_registers  On
  perf_event this code wasn't really doing anything useful, as
  update_control_state would end up re-doing any possible tests we could want
  to do here.

  * 1775566f src/Makefile.in src/Makefile.inc src/Rules.pfm4_pe...: Remove
  "include CPUCOMPONENT" from papi_internal.h  This was the last major
  dependency on CPU component in common PAPI code.  It was mostly necessary for
  the ucontext definitions when trying to get the instruction pointer when
  doing sampling.  This change creates new OS-specific header files that handle
  the ucontext related code, and has papi_internal.h include that instead.

  * 969ce035 src/Rules.pfm4_pe src/Rules.pfm_pe src/configure...: Make
  perf_event libpfm4 only  perf_event libpfm3 support is not really needed
  anymore and supporting it was cluttering up the perf_event component.

2012-07-13  

  * adad1d2a src/perf_events.c: Add init time error messages to perf_event
  component

  * 827ccc07 src/perf_events.c: Add perf_event rdpmc / fast_real_timer
  detection  Currently we need a custom copy of struct perf_event_mmap_page
  because the version included with libpfm4 doesn't define the fields we need
  yet.

  * 4f82fe94 src/perf_events.c: Read in paranoid info on perf_events  This
  indicates whether a regular user can read CPU-specific or system-wide
  measurements.

  * 03080450 src/perf_events.c: Add proper perf_event detection  Using the
  official /proc/sys/kernel/perf_event_paranoid file

  * 6e71d3f7 src/linux-bgq.c: Updated BGQ opcode stuff; cleaned up code.

2012-07-11  

  * 3114d3dc src/multiplex.c src/papi_internal.c src/perf_events.c: Minor
  documentation improvements  Plus fixes some typos

2012-07-09  

  * b60c0f0c src/perf_events.c: Minor cleanups to perf_events.c

  * 075278a0 src/aix.c src/freebsd.c src/linux-bgp.c...: Change return value
  for .allocate_registers  For some reason it returned 1 on success and 0 on
  failure.  Change it so you return PAPI_OK on success and a PAPI error on
  failure, to better match all of the other component vectors.

  * 29d9e62b src/testlib/test_utils.c: Fixed the print_header routine to report
  an error message if counters are not found, instead of a negative counter
  number. Tested by forcing the return value negative; not by running on a Mac,
  where the error first appeared.

  * 74257334 src/ctests/Makefile src/ctests/remove_events.c: Add remove_events
  test  This just makes sure EventSets still work after an event has been
  removed.  This is probably covered by other more elaborate tests, but I
  needed a simple test to make sure I wasn't breaking anything.

  * 1372714f src/papi.c src/papi_internal.c src/papi_internal.h: Clean up,
  rename, and comment _papi_hwi_remap_event_position  I've found this section
  of code to be confusing for a long time. I think I finally have it mostly
  figured out.  I've renamed it _papi_hwi_map_events_to_native() to better
  describe what it does.  The issue is that the native event list in an
  EventSet can change at various times.  At event add, event remove, and
  somewhat unexpectedly, whenever ->update_control_state is called (a component
  can re-arrange native events if it wants, to handle conflicts, etc.)  Once
  the native event list has been changed, _papi_hwi_map_events_to_native() has
  to be called to make sure the events all map to the proper native_event
  again.  Currently we have the _papi_hwi_map_events_to_native() calls in odd
  places. It seems to cover all possible needed locations, but analyzing that
  we do takes a lot of analysis...

  * f1b837d8 src/papi.c: Remove unused variable in papi.c

  * 541bcf44 src/papi_internal.h: Update commens in papi_internal.h  Some of
  the EventSetInfo comments were out of date.

  * e6587847 src/papi.c src/papi_internal.c src/papi_internal.h: Remove unused
  paramater from _papi_hwi_remap_event_position  The mysterious
  _papi_hwi_remap_event_position function had a "thisindex" field that was
  ignored.  This will possibly speed PAPI_start() time as it was running a loop
  over num_native_events on _papi_hwi_remap_event_position even though each
  call did the same thing since the value being passed was ignored.

  * 3ad3d14b src/papi_internal.c: Clean up and comment add_native_events in
  papi_internal.c  I'm chasing some weird perf_events behavior with the
  papi_event_chooser.  The add_native_events code is very hard to understand,
  working on commenting it more.

  * 4e5e7664 src/utils/event_chooser.c: Fix coverity warning in
  papi_event_chooser

  * 666249a8 src/jni/EventSet.java src/jni/FlipInfo.java
  src/jni/FlopInfo.java...: RIP Java.  Java PAPI wrappers have not been
  supported for years (2005?). They are being removed to declutter the source.

  * e18561fc src/papi_preset.c: Update cmpinfo->num_preset_events properly 
  This value wasn't being set if we were reading the presets directly from the
  CSV file.

  * 290ab7c3 src/utils/component.c: Have papi_component_avail report counter
  and event info

  * 7c421b9c src/testlib/test_utils.c src/utils/native_avail.c: Remove counter
  number from the testlib header.  The header was only reporting number of
  counters for the CPU component, even though the header is printed for many
  utils and the CPU component might not even be involved.  This could be a bit
  confusing, so remove it.

  * 26432359 src/darwin-common.c src/darwin-memory.c: Improve OSX support  This
  properly detects CPU information now.  You can get results like this: 
  Available native events and hardware information.
  
  - PAPI Version             : 4.9.0.0 Vendor string and code   : GenuineIntel

2012-07-08  

  * 845d9ecb src/Makefile.inc src/configure src/configure.in...: Add Mac OSX
  support  This is enough that things compile and simple utilities run.  No CPU
  perf counter support.

2012-07-06  

  * ff6f9ab4 src/linux-bgq.c: missed to delete a debug output.

2012-04-17  

  * 12e9a11a RELEASENOTES.txt: Release notes for the 4.4 release.

2012-07-06  

  * ac2eac56 src/papi.c src/papi.h: Add a PAPI_disable_component_by_name entry
  point.

  * 8c490849 src/components/coretemp_freebsd/coretemp_freebsd.c src/freebsd.c:
  Fix FreeBSD to work  I'm not sure how it ever worked in the past.  With these
  changes I can at least do a papi_component_avail and a papi_native_avail and
  get sane results

  * 108b5ce6 src/freebsd.c src/freebsd.h src/freebsd/map-atom.c...: Fix FreeBSD
  build  some of the recent changes broke the FreeBSD build

  * 40a60f0a src/linux-bgq.c src/linux-bgq.h: Added BGQ's opcode and generic
  event functionality to PAPI. For BGQ there are multiple ways to define
  presets. The naive way is to derive from multiple events. This eats up
  multiple counters and we lose sample capability as well as overflow
  capability. On the other side, some events come with multiple InstrGroup
  derived in the field. If that's the case we can use a generic event and
  opcodes to filter multiple groups in a single counter. This is not working
  properly yet due to a known error in BGPM. Bgpm_AddEvent() does not work
  properly when multiple generic events are added to an EventSet. The BGPM
  folks have been made aware of this issue, they confirmed the error, and they
  are currently working on a fix.

  * 6f72b70f src/papi_events_table.sh: Make this script robust enough to handle
  any line ending, including CR (Mac), CRLF (Windows), and LF (Unix). It
  appears that google mail now automagically converts attached files to CRLF
  format.

  * 765ed0d2 src/papi_internal.c: Fix a type warning in the UE code.

  * 94bc1b15 src/MACROS: Remove the MACROS file  it held out of date info and
  hasn't been touched since 2004

  * d19e73ba src/ctests/Makefile src/ctests/clockcore.c
  src/testlib/Makefile...: Move the clockcore.c file from ctests to testlib 
  it's common code used by multiple tests, including some in the utils
  directory  also add a function definition to fix a build-time warning

  * 1101a6aa src/aix-lock.h src/aix.h src/configure...: Make papi_lock.h
  changes for non Linux architectures

2012-07-05  

  * 3b82b03d src/Makefile.in src/Makefile.inc src/aix.c...: Make the PAPI locks
  be tied to OS, not to CPU  There is not a papi_lock.h file that when included
  gets the proper lock include for the OS.  This fixes a lot of previous build
  hacks where a CPU component was needed in order for locks to work.

  * 0632ef42 src/threads.c: Fix spurious init_thread call in threads.c 
  threads.c was calling init_thread() on all components, even ones that were
  disabled  Fix it to honor the disable bit, as well as for shutdown_thread(). 
  This was causing perfctr disable code to not work.

  * 19d9de7f src/Makefile.in src/Makefile.inc src/Rules.pfm4_pe...: Replace
  SUBSTRATE with CPUCOMPONENT in build  This was mostly a configure/build
  change but it also cleaned up some cases where we were including SUBSTRATE
  where we didn't have to.

  * 829780db src/solaris-common.c src/solaris-common.h
  src/solaris-niagara2.c...: Move some common solaris code to solaris-common

  * 681ef027 src/configure src/configure.in src/solaris-memory.c...: Merge
  solaris-memory.c and solaris-niagara2-memory.c

  * bbd41743 src/solaris-ultra/get_tick.S src/solaris.h: Remove
  solaris-ultra/get_tick.S  Nothing was using it.

  * dc3b6920 src/papi_sys_headers.h src/solaris.h: Remove papi_sys_headers.h 
  Solaris was the only thing including it, and it wasn't really using it.

  * 7ccfa9df src/Makefile.in src/Makefile.inc src/configure...: Move move OS
  specific code into the new OSFILESSRC  Linux in particular was using MISC for
  this.

  * 6f16c0c5 src/configure: Re-run autoconf to pickup the substrate=>component
  change.

  * cfff1ede src/Makefile.in src/Makefile.inc src/configure...: Remove
  MEMSUBSTR  In reality, what we want instead of a Memory Substrate is an idea
  of the OS-specific common code that includes the memory substrate.  This
  change adds OSFILESSRC and OSFILESOBJ to handle this case in configure

  * ca4729e6 src/configure.in: Separate out MEMSUBSTR and make it per-OS

  * 3148cba5 src/Matlab/PAPI_Matlab.dsp src/ctests/calibrate.c
  src/ctests/flops.c...: RIP Windows, remove the windows support code.  Windows
  has not been activly supported since the transition to Component PAPI (4.0)
  This cleans up the code-base.

2012-07-03  

  * a366adf7 src/papi.c src/utils/error_codes.c: Change PAPI_strerror and
  PAPI_perror to behave more like thir POSIX namesakes.  PAPI_error_descr is
  made redundant and removed as a result.

2012-07-05  

  * 7df46f81 src/Rules.pfm src/aix.c
  src/components/coretemp/linux-coretemp.c...: Move uses of PAPI_ESBSTR to
  PAPI_ECMP  I left PAPI_ESBSTR defined too for backward compatability.  Also
  some of the changes update PAPI_ESBSTR to be a more relevant error code, it
  one is available.

2012-07-03  

  * fdb348ad src/components/coretemp_freebsd/coretemp_freebsd.c
  src/components/example/example.c src/components/net/linux-net.c...: A few
  more substrate removals

  * 791747c1 src/cpus.c src/papi.h src/perf_events.c...: Fix bugs introduced by
  substrate -> component change  Fix some stupid compile bugs that I missed.

  * 79b01a47 src/aix.c src/components/appio/appio.c
  src/components/bgpm/CNKunit/linux-CNKunit.c...: More substrate -> component
  changes  This changes the vectors .init_substrate -> .init_component
  .shutdown_substrate -> .shutdown_substrate .init -> .init_thread .shutdown ->
  .shutdown_thread  hopefully this will make the code clearer.

  * 02a10d71 src/Makefile.inc src/aix.c src/cpus.c...: Rename "substrate" to
  "component"  This first pass only re-names things in comments.

2012-07-02  

  * c4bbff1c src/papi.c src/papi.h: Minor documentation fixes  Found when
  writing up the PAPI 5.0 changes document

2012-06-30  

  * f9cb7346 src/components/vmware/vmware.c: Fix vmware component  apparently I
  forgot to test the build with the vmguestlib support disabled.

2012-06-22  

  * 599040d1 src/components/coretemp/linux-coretemp.c
  src/components/rapl/linux-rapl.c
  src/components/stealtime/linux-stealtime.c...: Fix libpfm4 ntv_event_to_info
  event_info_t on other components  This was actually a widespead problem due
  to cut-and-paste.

  * 2b51b439 src/papi_libpfm4_events.c: Properly fix libpfm4 ntv_event_to_info
  event_info_t event value  The previous fix was subtly wrong.  This is the
  proper fix, which is to do nothing inside of papi_libpfm4_events.c because
  papi_internal.c does the right thing for us and we were overwriting that with
  the wrong value.

  * a4f576bf src/ctests/overflow_allcounters.c src/testlib/papi_test.h
  src/testlib/test_utils.c: Clean up overflow_allcounters code  While tracking
  down a previous issue I also cleaned up the overflow_allcounters test code to
  use some of the new interfaces.

  * 6903e053 src/papi_libpfm4_events.c: Fix libpfm4 ntv_event_to_info
  event_info_t event value  The recently added libpfm4 ntv_event_to_info
  function was not properly oring PAPI_NATIVE_MASK to the event value in the
  event_info_t struct.  That means if you tried to use that event value to add
  an event it would fail.  The overflow_allcounters test broke because of this.

  * 420c3d11 src/ctests/Makefile src/ctests/disable_component.c src/papi.c...:
  Add PAPI_get_component_index() and PAPI_disable_component() 
  PAPI_get_component_index() will return a component index if you give it the
  name of a component to match.  This saves you having to iterate the entire
  component list looking.  PAPI_disable_component() will manually mark a
  component as disabled. It has to be run before PAPI_library_init() is called.

  * 11946525 src/aix.c src/components/cuda/linux-cuda.c
  src/components/example/example.c...: Standardize component names to not end
  in .c  We were being inconsistent; the time to make them all be the same is
  now before 5.0 gets out.

2012-06-21  

  * 274e1ad8 src/components/vmware/tests/Makefile: Fix cut-and-paste error in
  the vmware component Makefile

  * 85d6438d src/utils/event_chooser.c: Update papi_event_chooser to work with
  components  Now you can specify events from components and it will tell you
  all the other events on that component that can run with it.  Previously the
  utility was limited to the CPU component (0) only.

  * 3c2fcc83 src/papi_libpfm3_events.c src/papi_libpfm4_events.c
  src/perf_events.c: Hook up .ntv_code_to_info on perf_event

  * 36e864b3 src/papi_libpfm4_events.c src/papi_libpfm_events.h
  src/perf_events.c: Enable support for showing extended umasks on perf_event 
  With this change, papi_native_avail now shows event umasks such as :u, :k,
  :c, :e, and :i. (user, kernel, cmask, edge-trigger, invert)  Thes are boolean
  or integer events.  They were supported by previous PAPI but they were never
  enumerated.

  * 8f3e305e src/components/coretemp/linux-coretemp.c: Fix cut-and-paste error 
  in linux-coretemp.c that could lead to wrong size being copied

  * 0eedd562 src/libpfm4/lib/events/intel_atom_events.h
  src/libpfm4/lib/events/intel_core_events.h
  src/libpfm4/lib/events/intel_coreduo_events.h...: Import most recent libpfm4
  git  This fixes an issue where there can be confusion between :i and :i=1
  type events.  It also has initial support for Uncore, though you need a
  specially patched kernel and PAPI does not support it yet.

  * 2f86ec78 src/components/appio/tests/Makefile
  src/components/appio/tests/appio_test_blocking.c
  .../appio/tests/appio_test_fread_fwrite.c...: - Fixed tests verbosity by
  using TESTS_QUIET macro - Fixed Makefile to only include necessary tests for
  automatic builds (skip blocking tests that read from stdin)

  * 6936b955 src/components/appio/README src/components/appio/appio.c
  src/components/appio/appio.h...: Added polling of read/write descriptor to
  check which operations would block.

  * 48cacccf src/papi.h: Add back PAPI_COMPONENT_INDEX() for backward
  compatability  It turns out some people were using this for cases other than
  enumeration.  The proper way to do things now is to use
  PAPI_get_event_component() which is what this PAPI_COMPONENT_INDEX() now maps
  to.

  * d1ed12b7 src/ctests/Makefile src/ctests/get_event_component.c
  src/papi.c...: Add PAPI_get_event_component()  This function returns the
  component an event belongs to.  It also adds a test to test this
  functionality.

2012-06-20  

  * ffccf633 src/papi.h: Add component_type field to .cmp_info  The idea is
  we'll specify CPU, I/O, GPU, hardware, etc.

  * 9998eecc src/components/lmsensors/Rules.lmsensors: Another lmsensors build
  fix

  * caa94d64 src/components/lmsensors/linux-lmsensors.c: Update lmsensors
  component to actually compile.  I finally found a machine with lmsensors
  installed.

  * fbcde325 src/components/lmsensors/linux-lmsensors.c
  src/components/lmsensors/linux-lmsensors.h: Update lmsensor component  Unlike
  the other components it hadn't been updated to PAPI 5 standards.  Also, it
  was wrongly de-allocating all state in "_shutdown" rather than
  "_shutdown_substrate" which was causing double-frees during tests.

  * 0d3c0ae2 src/papi_internal.c: Add some extra debugging to
  _papi_hwi_get_native_event_info

  * 5961c03d src/aix.c src/components/nvml/linux-nvml.c
  src/ctests/subinfo.c...: Remove cntr_groups from .cmp_info  This information
  is better exposed by enumeration.

  * 2b4193fd src/utils/event_chooser.c: Cleanup and comment event_chooser code

  * 7f9fab2b src/ctests/all_native_events.c: Cleanup and add comments to
  all_native_events.c

  * a245b502 src/components/nvml/linux-nvml.c src/ctests/subinfo.c
  src/freebsd.c...: Remove profile_ear from .cmp_info  The CPU components
  should handle this internally.

  * bca07f3c src/papi.c: Add comments to the PAPI_sprofil code.

  * b1e2090c src/papi.c: Minor papi.c cleanups  Fix some minor cosmetic things,
  including a typo in a comment.

  * 8f3aef4a src/ctests/subinfo.c src/papi.h: Remove opcode_match_width field
  from .cmp_info  This should be exposed via enumeration and not by a field in
  the generic cmp_info structure.

  * 047af629 src/components/nvml/linux-nvml.c src/ctests/subinfo.c
  src/papi.h...: Remove cntr_OPCM_events field from .cmp_info  This should be
  exposed via enumeration and not by a field in the generic cmp_info structure.

  * 3f1f9e10 src/components/nvml/linux-nvml.c src/ctests/subinfo.c
  src/papi.h...: Remove cntr_DEAR_events field from .cmp_info  This should be
  exposed via enumeration and not by a field in the generic cmp_info structure.

  * 962c642a src/components/nvml/linux-nvml.c src/ctests/subinfo.c
  src/papi.h...: Remove cntr_IEAR_events field from .cmp_info  This should be
  exposed via enumeration and not by a field in the generic cmp_info structure.

  * 5aa7eac1 src/components/nvml/linux-nvml.c src/ctests/subinfo.c
  src/papi.h...: Remove instr_address_range from .cmp_info  This feature should
  be deteced via enumeration, not via a flag in the generic .cmp_info
  structure.

  * 1bf68d5d src/components/nvml/linux-nvml.c src/ctests/subinfo.c
  src/papi.h...: Remove data_address_range field from .cmp_info  The proper way
  to detect this feature is via enumeration.

2012-06-19  

  * 90037307 src/linux-context.h: Change Linux from using "struct siginfo" to
  "siginfo_t"  This conforms to POSIX, and fixes newer Fedora where struct
  siginfo is no longer supported.  This can in theory break on older setups
  (possibly kernel 2.4). If that happens, we need to somehow detect this using
  autoconf.

2012-06-18  

  * ad48b4fa src/Rules.perfctr-pfm: Fix the perfctr-pfm build; for buildbot,
  mostly.  Have the perfctr-pfm build only build libpfm, like the perfevents
  builds. The icc build was choking on warnings (-Werror => errors) in the
  example programs with libpfm, this is not something we depend upon.

2012-06-17  

  * 358b14f9 src/papi_events.csv: Update BGQ presets

  * cf26fc87 src/components/bgpm/CNKunit/linux-CNKunit.c
  src/components/bgpm/IOunit/linux-IOunit.c
  src/components/bgpm/L2unit/linux-L2unit.c...: Update bgpm components
  according to the papi5 changes

  * a7b08a91 src/configure src/configure.in src/linux-bgq.c: Merging the BG/Q
  stuff from stable_4.2 to PAPI 5 did break it. It's corrected now; also
  predefined events are now working.)

2012-06-15  

  * 2d5a4205 src/components/bgpm/IOunit/linux-IOunit.c
  src/components/bgpm/L2unit/linux-L2unit.c src/configure...: Merging the BG/Q
  stuff from stable_4.2 to PAPI 5 did break it. It's corrected now (almost);
  predefined events are not working yet.)

  * 1b034920 src/papi.c: Re-enable PAPI_event_name_to_code() optimization  In
  PAPI_event_name_to_code() there was a commented-out optimization where we
  would check if an event name begins with "PAPI_" before searching the entire
  preset list for an event name.  The comment says we had to disable this due
  to "user events", but a check shows that was introduced in e7bd768850ecf90
  and that the "user events" it means is not the current support, but the
  now-removed PAPI_set_event_info() function where you could change the names
  of presets on the fly (even to something not starting with PAPI_).  Since we
  don't support that anymore, we can re-enable the optimization.

  * 9a26b43d src/papi_internal.c src/papi_internal.h src/papi_preset.c: Remove
  the 16-component limit  This turned out to be easier than I thought it would
  be.  Now determining which component an event is in is a two step process. 
  Before, the code shifted and masked to find the component from bits 26-30. 
  Now, _papi_hwi_component_index() is used.  There's a new native event table
  which maps all native events (which are allocated incrementally at first use
  starting with 0x4000000) to two values, a component number and an "internal"
  event number.

  * d5c50353 src/papi_internal.c: Fix for the PAPI_COMPONENT_MASK change  I
  missed two cases in papi_internal.c This was causing the overflow_allcounters
  test to fail

  src/components/bgpm/CNKunit/linux-CNKunit.h
  src/components/bgpm/IOunit/linux-IOunit.c...: Updating the Q substrate
  according to the PAPI 5 changes

  * 05a8dcbf src/components/appio/appio.c
  src/components/appio/tests/appio_list_events.c
  src/components/appio/tests/appio_values_by_code.c...: First steps of removing
  16-component limit  This change removes PAPI_COMPONENT_INDEX(),
  PAPI_COMPONENT_MASK and PAPI_COMPONENT_AND_MASK.  It adds the new functions
  _papi_hwi_component_index() _papi_hwi_native_to_eventcode()
  _papi_hwi_eventcode_to_native()  By replacing all of the former macros with
  the equivelant of the latter functions, it allows all of the future
  16-component limit changes to be made in the functions.  Components now
  receive as events a plain 32-bit value as their internal native event; the
  high bits are not set.  This may break some external components.  This change
  should not break things, but a lot of testing is needed.

  * af4cbb86 src/run_tests_exclude.txt: Exclude iozone helper scripts from
  run_tests.  run_tests.sh looks for executible files under components/*/tests
  Some of the plotting scripts in appio/iozone were getting picked up.

2012-06-12  

  * c10c7ccb src/configure src/configure.in: Configure does not work on BGQ due
  to missing subcomp feature. It worked for stable-4.2 but got lost in current
  git origin.

  * d9a58148 src/aix.c src/ctests/hwinfo.c src/ctests/overflow.c...: Update
  hw_info_t CPU frequency reporting.  Previously PAPI reported "float mhz" and
  "int clock_mhz". In theory the first was the current CPU speed, and the
  latter was the resolution of the cycle counter.  In practice they were both
  set to the same value (on Linux, read from /proc/cpuinfo) and not very useful
  when DVFS was enabled, as the value reported was usually lower than the
  actual frequency running once CPU started being used.  This change adds two
  new values "cpu_max_mhz" and "cpu_min_mhz" which are read from
  /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/cpuinfo_max_freq and
  /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/cpuinfo_min_freq if they are available,
  and falls back to /proc/cpuinfo otherwise.  All of the tests were updated to
  use cpu_max_mhz.  The old mhz and clock_mhz values are left for compatability
  reasons (and set to cpu_max_mhz) but are currently unused otherwise.

  This adds IvyBridge support

  * 3bb983cc src/libpfm-3.y/examples_v2.x/self_smpl_multi.c: Fix a libpfm3
  example program for icc, local fix because libpfm3 is deprecated.  icc does
  have more enjoyable warnings than gcc, : error 186: pointless comparison of
  unsigned integer with zero  on this: unsigned int foo; ... if ( foo < 0 )

  * d28adccf src/papi_user_events.c: The user events code had a call to exit,
  this was bad...

2012-06-04  

  * 6bf43022 src/testlib/test_utils.c: Further the hack for testing for perf SW
  events.  Events like
  
  - | perf::CPU-CLOCK

        |
  
  - were passing the check, now we also check the event_info_struct.long_descr
  field for PERF_COUNT_SW....

  * fa4b1a28 src/components/nvml/linux-nvml.c: Cleanup nvml code a little.  A
  few print statements were left over from debugging. Also check errors from
  nvml and cuda pciinfo functions, disabling the component in a few more cases.

2012-06-01  

  * da144a94 src/components/nvml/Makefile.nvml.in src/components/nvml/README
  src/components/nvml/Rules.nvml...: Rewrite and merge of the nVidia Management
  library component.  This component attempts to expose all supported
  'performance counters' on each card cuda knows about at runtime. Much like
  the cuda component reads happen on the card you're executing on at PAPI_read
  time.  The test included is a copy of the cuda helloworld test, but it
  attempts to start/stop the event on each gpgpu. If you select an event that
  is not supported on the card you're running on we should fail gracefully but
  this has not been tested.

2012-05-23  

  * b2d414dc src/components/stealtime/linux-stealtime.c: At units to stealtime
  component  Added the function but forgot to add a function vector for it.

  * ce9d4500 src/components/stealtime/linux-stealtime.c: Add units to stealtime
   Properly report that the units are in micro seconds.

  * 149948c8 src/components/rapl/linux-rapl.c: Minor cleanup of RAPL code 
  missing "void" paramter in init_substrate function

  * 6a7e22fa src/components/vmware/vmware.c: More vmware component fixes.  This
  makes the component thread-safe.  Also makes it fail more gracefully if the
  guestlib SDK is installed but does not support our hypervisor (for example,
  if we are running under VM Workstation).  Still need to test on ESX.

  * 072d6473 src/components/appio/tests/appio_test_select.c: added code to
  intercept and time select() calls.

2012-05-22  

  * 12b6d0d7 src/components/vmware/vmware.c: Some more minor fixes to VMware
  component  Try to handle things better if VMguest SDK not working

  * 6e015bc5 src/components/vmware/Rules.vmware src/components/vmware/vmware.c:
  More vmware component fixups  Now works with the events from the VMguest SDK
  library

  * 5fc0f646 src/components/vmware/vmware.c: More cleanup of vmware component 
  The pseudo-performance counters work again.  Now they behave in accumulate
  mode, like all other PAPI counters.

  * f72b0967 src/components/vmware/tests/vmware_basic.c: Make vmware test a bit
  more complete

  * 070e5481 src/components/vmware/tests/Makefile

  * b32ae1ae src/components/stealtime/Rules.stealtime
  src/components/stealtime/linux-stealtime.c
  src/components/stealtime/tests/Makefile...: Add a stealtime component  When
  running in a VM, this provides information on how much time was "stolen" by
  the hypervisor due to the VM being disabled.  This info is gathered from
  column 8 of /proc/stat  This currently only works on KVM.

  * 9e95b480 src/components/appio/tests/appio_test_blocking.c: Use a

  Fix some component warnings.

  * 0447f373 src/configure src/configure.in src/linux-generic.h: Make build not
  stall if PAPI_EVENTS_CSV not set  This is some fallout from the FreeBSD
  changes. PAPI_EVENTS_CSV could not be set, which would make the event
  creation script hang forever.  Also catch various fallthroughs in the code
  where SUBSTR wasn't being set, which is how the above problem can happen.

  * ef484c00 src/linux-timer.h: Fix typo in linux-timer.h

2012-05-14  

  * ad7e3fa0 src/components/rapl/linux-rapl.c: Properly accumulate RAPL results
   Previously it was resetting the counts on read, instead of continuing to
  count as per other PAPI events.

  * c79e3018 src/components/rapl/tests/rapl_overflow.c: Fix some warnings in
  rapl_overflow test

  * 731afd1a src/components/rapl/tests/Makefile
  src/components/rapl/tests/rapl_overflow.c: Add rapl_overflow test  This test
  sees if we can measure RAPL in conjunction with overflow CPU performance
  events.

  * b0e201bb src/components/rapl/utils/Makefile
  src/components/rapl/utils/rapl_plot.c: Remove derived "uncore" values from
  rapl tool  They weren't really measuring uncore, but were just TOTAL - PP0. 
  It was causing some confusion.

2012-05-09  

  * 547e9379 doc/Doxyfile-common papi.spec src/Makefile.in...: Bump the version
  number to 4.9.0.0  Read 4.9 as pre-5.0 master was at version number 4.2.1,
  this was archaic... Sorry for the confusion Tushar, master is the correct
  branch for the latest development code.

  * 133e3d67 src/configure src/configure.in: Fix perfctr build  In the FreeBSD
  changes I removed the CPU determination by reading /proc/cpuinfo as that was
  prone to failure and non-portable.  This broke perfctr as it was doing a huge
  CPU name lookup to determine if it was on an x86 system or not.  This change
  fixes that.

2012-05-08  

  * 42b21d67 src/papi_libpfm4_events.c: Fix PAPI event enumeration inside of
  VMware  VMware disables the availability of architectural events when
  virtualized PMU is not available.  libpfm4 was checkign this when enumerating
  events, and we would end up in the situation where ix86arch was marked active
  but 0 events were available.  We didn't check for this error condition and
  thus end up thoroughly confused.

2012-05-07  

  * fd79a584 src/freebsd.c: Fix event enumeration on FreeBSD  It was passing
  PAPI_OK in all cases, causing papi_native_avail to try to do things like
  report groups even when groups weren't available.

  * 53732c2e src/freebsd.c: Add Virtual Machine detection support to FreeBSD 
  again, support for this on x86 is OS Neutral

  * 7b4d7c96 src/configure src/configure.in src/freebsd-memory.c...: Add
  x86_cacheinfo support to FreeBSD  The x86 cache and memory info is
  OS-independent, so add support for it to FreeBSD.

  * e1554ed8 src/configure: re-run autoconf for updated configure

  * 1deb2f5d src/Makefile.inc: Make sure a proper dependency for
  papi_events_table.h exists  Our Makefile code that builds a shared library is
  way broken; it will fail to rebuild in many cases where the static library
  properly detects thing.

  * 28e28006 src/configure.in: Make papi_events_table.h build normally, not by
  configure.

  * 9a66dfa5 src/configure.in: Another place papi_events_table.sh is called

  * 12e4a934 src/Makefile.inc src/papi_events_table.sh: Make

2012-04-27  

  * 5d661b2d src/Rules.pfm src/Rules.pfm_pe: Add the libpfm -Wno-override-init
  bandaid to the other rules files.  In
  b33331b66137668155c02e52c98a7e389fad402e we test if gcc -Wextra complains
  about some structure initialization that libpfm does. This was incoperated
  into Rules.pfm4_pe only.  Jim Galarowicz noticed the other Rules files didn't
  have it.

  * 4349b6fd src/Rules.pfm4_pe src/Rules.pfm_pe: Cleanup the perf events Rules
  files.  Steve Kaufmann reported that CONFIG_PFMLIB_OLD_PFMV2 is only used for
  libpfm3 builds targeting old versions of perfmon2.

  * b248ae80 doc/Makefile: Have clean remove the doxygen error file.

  * 1d4f75a3 doc/Doxyfile-man1 doc/Doxyfile-man3: Fix an error in the Doxygen
  config files.  Doxygen includes things with @INCLUDE not @include. The html
  file had this, the man page files did not...

  * 979cda20 cvs2cl.pl delete_before_release.sh gitlog2changelog.py...: Update
  the release machinery for git.  gitlog2changelog.py takes the output of git
  log and parses it to something like a changelog.

  * 67bdd45f doc/Doxyfile-html: Cover up an instance of doxygen using full
  paths.  Doxygen ( up to 1.8.0, the most recent at this writing ) would use
  full paths in directory dependencies ignoring the use relative paths config
  option.

  src/libpfm-3.y/lib/intel_wsm_events.h src/libpfm-3.y/lib/pfmlib_intel_nhm.c:
  Add missing update to libpfm3  Somehow during all of the troubles we had with
  importing libpfm3 into CVS, we lost some Nehalem/Westmere updates.  Tested on
  a Nehalem machine to make sure this doesn't break anything.

  * 193d8d06 src/papi_libpfm3_events.c: Fix max_multiplex case on
  perf_event/libpfm3  num_mpx_cntrs was being set to 512 even though the real
  maximum is 32, causing a buffer overflow and segfault.

2012-04-12  

  * f1f7fb5b src/threads.h: Fix minor typo in a comment

  * 0373957d src/linux-timer.c: Fix potential fd leak  Noticed by coverity
  checker.

  * 71727e38 src/ctests/max_multiplex.c: Improve max_multiplex ctest  on
  perfmon2, this test was failing because the maximum number of multiplexed
  counters was much more than the available counters we could test with.  This
  change modifies the test to not fail in this case.

2012-04-11  

  * fdbdac9f src/perfmon.c: Fix the perfmon substrate.  It was missing a
  _papi_libpfm_init() call, which meant the number of events was being left at
  0.

2012-04-09  

  * 2a44df97 src/libpfm-3.y/examples_v2.x/multiplex.c
  src/libpfm-3.y/examples_v2.x/pfmsetup.c
  src/libpfm-3.y/examples_v2.x/rtop.c...: Catch a few libpfm-3.y files up to
  libpfm-3.10.  More skeletons keep falling out of the cvs closet. This is just
  what diff -q -r catches.

2012-04-04  

  * 0e05da68 src/components/rapl/utils/Makefile
  src/components/rapl/utils/README src/components/rapl/utils/rapl_plot.c: Add
  the rapl_plot utility to the RAPL component.  This utility uses PAPI to
  periodicly poll the RAPL counters and generate average power results suitable
  for plotting.  There's been a lot of interest in this utility so it's
  probably useful to include it with the RAPL component.

  * 2daa03ac src/papi_internal.c: Check if a component is disabled at init
  time.  This change modifies the code so that at PAPI_library_init() time we
  check the component disable field, and we don't call the init routines for
  components the user has disabled.  This allows code like the following to
  happen _before_ PAPI_library_init():  numcmp = PAPI_num_components();
  for(cid=0; cid<numcmp; cid++) { cmpinfo = PAPI_get_component_info(cid); if
  (strstr(cmpinfo->name,"cuda")) { cmpinfo->disabled=1;
  strncpy(cmpinfo->disabled_reason,"Disabled by user",PAPI_MAX_STR_LEN); } } 
  We might want to add a specific PAPI_disable_component(int cid) call of maybe
  even a PAPI_disable_component(char *name) as the above code causes compiler
  warnings since cmpinfo is returned as a const pointer.  This all works
  because currently PAPI currently statically allocates all of the components
  at compile time, so we can view and modify the cmp_info structure before
  PAPI_library_init() is called.

  * 3fd2b21e src/components/appio/README src/components/appio/appio.c
  src/components/appio/appio.h...: Added support to count reads that are
  interrupted or would block.

  * deac54cc src/components/coretemp/linux-coretemp.c
  src/components/coretemp/tests/coretemp_basic.c
  src/components/coretemp/tests/coretemp_pretty.c...: Add new
  PAPI_enum_cmp_event() function  This will be needed when we remove the
  16-component limit.  Currently in PAPI_enum_event() the component number is
  gathered from bits 29-26 of the eventcode.  This won't work anymore once we
  remove those bits.  Also update the various components to not use
  PAPI_COMPONENT_MASK() as this too will go away in the transition.

  * 48331cc9 src/configure src/configure.in src/papi.c...: Place all
  compiled-in components in the _papi_hwd[] array.  Previously we had separate
  compiled_in[] and _papi_hwd[] arrays. At init time a pointer to the
  compiled_in[] was copied to _papi_hwd[] if initialization passed.  This kind
  of code setup makes enumerating components hard, and finding info from
  non-available components would require additional function entry points. 
  This change leaves all compiled in components to _papi_hwd[]. Availability of
  the component can be checked with the new "disabled" field.  This will make
  enumeration support a lot easier to add. It can possibly cause user confusion
  if they try to access component structures directly without checking the
  "disabled" field first.  This change should also make any eventual support
  for run-time component enabling/disabling a lot easier.

  * 66a72f44 src/papi.c: Documentation was referring to nonexistent
  "PAPI_enum_events()"  The actual function we have is PAPI_enum_event()

  * 0f2c2593 src/components/coretemp/linux-coretemp.c
  src/components/lustre/linux-lustre.c src/components/mx/linux-mx.c...: Add
  support for reporting reason for failed component initialization.  This
  change adds the fields "disabled" and "disabled_reason" to the
  component_info_t structure.  At initialization time, PAPI will set the
  "disabled" field to the value returned by component init (that is PAPI_OK if
  OK or an error otherwise).  This can be checked later to find why component
  init failed.  Also provided is the "disabled_reason" string.  The components
  can set this at failure time, and this can be printed later.  For example,
  this is sample output of the updated papi_component_avail routine:

  * b44d60ca src/components/appio/appio.c src/components/appio/appio.h
  src/components/appio/tests/appio_test_read_write.c: Added support for
  intercepting open calls.

2012-03-23  

  * 9e9fac4b src/Makefile.in src/Rules.pfm4_pe src/configure...: Fix the test
  case in configure at 0cea1848  Make use of the structure we're using for the
  override-init test case.

  * 0cea1848 src/configure src/configure.in: Doctor CFLAGS when testing for a
  gcc warning.  -Wextra was not in CFLAGS when I attempted to check for the
  initialized field overwritten warning. So we set -Wall -Wextra -Werror when
  running the test code.

2012-03-22  

  * b33331b6 src/Makefile.in src/Rules.pfm4_pe src/configure...: Fix
  initialized field overwritten warning when building libpfm4 on some gcc
  versions.  In gcc 4.2 or so, -Woverride-init was added to -Wextra causing
  issues with code like struct foo { int a; int b;};  struct foo bar = { .a=0,
  .b=0, .b=5; };  --Wno-override-init allows us to keep -Werror for libpfm4
  compiles.

2012-03-21  

  * ae149766 src/papi_internal.h: Delete an old comment.  Yes, Dan in 2003, we
  should and do use MAX_COUNTER_TERMS as the size of the event position array.

2012-03-20  

  * b937cdd8 src/papi_user_events.c: Move the user events code over to using
  the new preset event data structure.

2012-03-14  

  * 6ca599e2 src/papi_internal.c: Fix a small memory leak.  We weren't freeing
  _papi_hwd, causing a lot of MEM_LEAK warnings in buildbot.

2012-03-13  

  * 473b8203 src/aix.h src/configure src/configure.in...: Remove last MY_VECTOR
  usage.  Have configure explicitly set the name of the perf counter substrate
  vector in the components_config.h file  This removes one more special case,
  and gets us slightly closer to being able to have multiple CPU substrates
  compiled in at once.

  * 360c3003 src/papi.c src/papi_libpfm3_events.c src/papi_libpfm_events.h...:
  Clean up the papi_libpfm3_events.c code.  Move code that was perfctr specific
  into perfctr-x86.c

  * 03de65e3 src/libpfm-3.y/examples_v2.x/multiplex.c
  src/libpfm-3.y/examples_v2.x/pfmsetup.c
  src/libpfm-3.y/examples_v2.x/rtop.c...: Fix some libpfm3 warnings.  libpfm3
  is not maintained anymore, so applied these changes locally.  libpfm3 is
  compiled with -Werror so they broke the build with newer gcc even though they
  are just warnings in example programs.

  * ad490353 src/ctests/zero_named.c src/utils/multiplex_cost.c: Fix a few
  compiler warnings in the tests.

  * a0fec783 src/linux-timer.c: Fix another linux-timer.c compile problem.  I
  hadn't tested with debug enabled, so all of buildbot failed last night.

2012-03-12  

  * a3733ecd src/linux-timer.h: Fix typo in the linux-timer.h header 
  _linux_get_virt_usec_timess should have been _linux_get_virt_usec_times 
  Thanks to Steve Kaufmann for noticing this.

  * 785db5ae src/linux-common.c src/linux-timer.c: Fix timer compile on Power
  machines  Power, ARM, and MIPS have no get_cycles() call so provide a dummy
  function on these architectures.

  * 708090ee src/linux-common.c src/linux-timer.h: Another fix for non-POSIX
  timers  The recent changes had the name of the fallback usec method wrong.

  * 88e8d355 src/papi_libpfm3_events.c: Fix a warning in the libpfm3 code.

  * 8ca63705 src/configure src/configure.in src/linux-common.c...: Fix build
  when not using POSIX timers  The PAPI build system was being overly clever
  with how it defined what kind of wall clock timers were to be used, so of
  course I broke things when breaking the timer code out to make it a bit more
  understandable.  This patch breaks out the timer define into two pieces; one
  saying it's a POSIX timer and one saying whether to use HR timers or not.

2012-03-09  

  * b69ad727 src/linux-common.c src/linux-timer.c src/linux-timer.h: Add Linux
  posix gettime() nanosecond functions

  * af2c9a49 src/papi.c src/papi_vector.c src/papi_vector.h: Add
  ->get_virt_nsec() and ->get_real_nsec() OS vectors  Currently PAPI was just
  cheating and running the usec functions and multiplying by 1000.  Make this
  the default, but allow the OS code to override if they have timers capable of
  returning nsec percision.

  * 24c68dbe src/aix.c src/freebsd.c src/linux-bgp.c...: Clean up
  ->get_virt_usec()  It no longer needs to be passed a context, so remove that
  from all callers.  Also, ->get_virt_cycles() was just a get_virt_usec()*MHz
  on most platforms.  While this is a bit dubious (especially as MHz can't be
  relied on) make this a common routine that will be added at innoculate time
  if ->get_virt_cycles() is set to NULL.

  * a3ef7cef src/linux-common.c src/linux-timer.c src/linux-timer.h: Cleanup
  the Linux timer code.  Split things up a bit to make the code more readable.

  * 50ce8ea0 src/papi_internal.c: Change a strcpy() to strncpy() just to be a
  bit safer.

  * 0526b125 src/components/lmsensors/linux-lmsensors.c: Fix buffer overrun in
  lmsensors component

  * b088db70 src/libpfm4/config.mk
  src/libpfm4/docs/man3/pfm_get_os_event_encoding.3
  src/libpfm4/examples/showevtinfo.c...: Update to current git libpfm4 snapshot

  * ccb45f61 src/aix.c src/extras.c: Fix segfault on AIX  During some of the
  cleanups, the extras.h header was not added to aix.c  This made some of the
  functions (silently) use default data types for the function parameters,
  leading to segfaults in some of the tests.

2012-03-08  

  * 1cb22d0b src/components/coretemp/linux-coretemp.c src/utils/native_avail.c:
  Make "native_avail -d" report units if available  Add units support to the
  coretemp component, have native_avail -d (detailed mode) print it to make
  sure it works.

  * 9c54840e src/extras.c src/extras.h src/papi_internal.c...: Add new
  ntv_code_to_info vector  This will allow components to return the extended
  event_info data for native events.  If a component doesn't implement
  ntv_code_to_info then get_event_info falls back to the old way of just
  reporting symbol name and long description.

  * c4579559 src/papi.h: Add new event_info fields  New fields are added to
  event_info that allow passing on extended information.  This includes things
  such as measurement units, data type, location, timescope, etc.

  * 17533e4e src/ctests/all_events.c src/ctests/derived.c
  src/ctests/kufrin.c...: Restore fields to event_info structure  The changes
  made were probably too ambitious, even for a 5.0 release.  In the end it
  looks like we can remain API compatible while just using up a little more
  memory.  We can still save space by shrinking preset_t behind the scenes.

  * 6f13a5f6 src/aix.c src/components/coretemp/linux-coretemp.c
  src/components/coretemp_freebsd/coretemp_freebsd.c...: Remove
  ->ntv_bits_to_info vector from component interface  We weren't using it
  anymore, and many of the components were just setting it to NULL
  unncessarily.  We'll be replacing the functionality soon with
  ntv_code_to_info

  * 401f37bc src/components/example/example.c src/ctests/subinfo.c src/papi.h:
  Remove invert and edge_detect fields from component info  These fields were
  there to indicate if a CPU component supported these attributes (for Intel
  processors) but in the end we never used these.  The proper way to export
  this info is during event enumeration.

  * f32fe481 src/papi_events.csv: We had the PAPI_VEC_INS preset wrong on amd
  fam12h llano

  * 38a8d8a7 src/ctests/multiplex2.c src/papi_preset.c: Fix preset adding code
  to be more robust.  If an invalid event is in a preset definition, we'd
  currently add it with an eventcode of 0 to the preset, which would break if
  you tried to use the event.  This change properly prints a warning in this
  case, and sets the preset to be unavailable.

  * 2591a546 src/ctests/val_omp.c src/ctests/zero_omp.c: Remove the hw_info
  field from add_two_events calls.  Two ctests missed the bus when Vince
  reworked the add_two_events call.

  * 358a2e32 src/papi_internal.c src/papi_preset.c: Fix segfault seen on an AMD
  fusion machine  With the recent preset and component hanges, we were not
  properly resetting papi_num_components if PAPI_library_init()/PAPI_shutdown()
  was called multiple times.

2012-03-07  

  * 7751f5d8 src/ftests/zeronamed.F: Fix a compile error on aix.  Dan ran over
  72 characters on a single line. xlf actually enforced that part the Fortran
  spec.

2012-03-06  

  * 1c87d89c src/ftests/Makefile src/ftests/zeronamed.F src/papi_fwrappers.c:
  Add support for {add, remove, query}_named to Fortran interface; add zero
  named.F test case; modify ftests Makefile to support "all" tag.

  * 71bd4fdd src/configure src/configure.in: Modify configure to define the
  default FTEST_TARGETS as "all"

  * 54e39855 src/components/vmware/vmware.c: Changed tri8ggering environment
  variable to PAPI_VMWARE_PSEUDOPERFORMANCE per Vince's earlier email. This
  should complete all the VMware component changes.

2012-03-05  

  * 845503fb src/Makefile.inc: Add missing MISCSRCS line to Makefile.inc  This
  was breaking the shared library build

2012-02-01  

  * 11be8e4b .../appio/tests/appio_test_fread_fwrite.c
  src/components/appio/tests/appio_test_pthreads.c
  src/components/appio/tests/appio_test_read_write.c: updated these tests to
  print timing information

  * 9ad62ab1 src/components/appio/README src/components/appio/appio.c
  src/components/appio/appio.h...: Added support for timing I/O calls. Updated
  tests and README.

2012-01-31  

  * beaa5ff0 src/components/appio/tests/iozone/Changes.txt
  src/components/appio/tests/iozone/Generate_Graphs
  src/components/appio/tests/iozone/Gnuplot.txt...: added the latest stable
  iozone to the appio tests.

  * 4af58174 src/components/appio/README src/components/appio/tests/Makefile
  src/components/appio/tests/init_fini.c: added a hook to run the appio test
  for iozone.

2012-01-21  

  * 15c733cf src/components/appio/CHANGES src/components/appio/README
  src/components/appio/appio.c...: Removed stray 'net' references. All
  remaining references are only for the purpose of giving credit. Updated
  change log.

2012-01-20  

  * ca4b6785 src/components/appio/README src/components/appio/appio.c
  src/components/appio/tests/appio_list_events.c...: - general cleanup -
  improved tests to be quiet and be conform to other PAPI tests - replaced
  hardwire constants in appio.c with symbolic ones - tests will now write to
  /dev/null to avoid filling the terminal screen with useless text - more
  comments added - @author added to files - updated README

2012-01-18  

  * bb22ed9f src/components/appio/README src/components/appio/Rules.appio
  src/components/appio/appio.c...: - Added support to measure
  bytes/calls/eof/short calls for read/write calls. - Interception of
  read/write and fread/fwrite calls. - Works for static and dynamic linkage
  (without need for LD_PRELOAD) - Tested OK on 32-bit i686 Linux 2.6.38.

  * ba748a41 src/components/vmware/configure: Remove old configuration
  parameters from vmware/configure

2012-03-02  

  * 2b7e2abb src/ctests/Makefile src/ctests/max_multiplex.c: Add a new
  max_multiplex test  This tries to use the maximum number of multiplexed
  events.  This was written in response to the 32/64 perf_event multiplexed
  event limit reported by Mohammad j. Ranji

  * a0985ff5 src/multiplex.c src/papi_internal.c src/papi_libpfm4_events.c...:
  Fix issue when using more than 32 multiplexed events on perf_event  On
  perf_event we were setting num_mpx_cntrs to 64.  This broke, as the
  MPX_EventSet struct only allocates room for PAPI_MPX_DEF_DEG events, which is
  32.  This patch makes perf_event use a value of 32 for num_mpx_cntrs,
  especially as 64 was arbitrarily chosen at some point (the actual value
  perf_event can support is static, but I'm pretty sure it is higher than 64).

  * 331c516c src/ctests/acpi.c: Remove the acpi.c file from ctests  It wasn't
  being built, and we removed the ACPI component a while ago.

  * 73e7d191 src/components/vmware/vmware.c: Removed all old references to
  #define VMWARE_PSEUDO_PPERF and switched over to getenv

2012-03-01  

  * 969b8aa9 src/ctests/Makefile src/ctests/zero_named.c src/papi.c: Three new
  APIs: PAPI_query_named_event PAPI_add_named_event PAPI_remove_named_event and
  a new test: zero_named Still to do: maybe test named native events and
  support Fortran

  * 97bf9bf8 src/papi.c src/papi.h: First pass implementation of {add, remove,
  query}_named_event

  * 2416af88 src/components/vmware/vmware.c: Add functionality to getenv
  selectors

  * 297f9cd6 src/papi.c: Fix possible race in _papi_hwi_gather_all_thrspec_data
   The valgrind helgrind tool noticed this with the thrspecific test

  * be599976 src/papi_internal.c: Add some locking in
  _papi_hwi_shutdown_global_internal  This caused a glibc double-free warning,
  and was caught by the Valgrind helgrind tool in krentel_pthreads  There are
  some other potential locking issues in PAPI_shutdown, especially when debug
  is enabled.

  * 8444d577 src/utils/clockres.c src/utils/command_line.c: Cleanup the oxygen
  markup for the utilities.

  * 7144394f doc/Doxyfile-html: Missed a recursive tag for the html config
  file.

  * 63b2efc4 src/papi_preset.c: Fix segfaults in tests on AMD machines  The
  papi_preset code was wrongly calling papi_free() on some code that was
  allocated with strdup()  (not with papi_malloc).  We were only noticing this
  on AMD machines because it was the code for freeing developer notes in
  presets, and currently only AMD events have developer notes.

  * 0b1350df src/linux-common.c: Touch 'virtual_vendor_name' to cleanup a
  warning on bluegrass.

2012-02-29  

  * 1f17b571 src/Makefile.inc src/Rules.perfctr-pfm src/Rules.pfm4_pe...: Merge
  the contents of papi_libpfm_presets.c into papi_preset.c  The code isn't
  libpfm specific at all anymore, it's the generic "read presets from a file"
  code.  It makes more sense to find it in papi_presets.c

  * d087d49f src/papi_fwrappers.c: Fix Fortran breakage after the preset event
  changes

  * 156141ec src/papi_libpfm_presets.c src/papi_preset.c src/papi_preset.h:
  Simplify papi_libpfm_presets.c  Previously adding presets from
  papi_events.csv was a three step process.  1.  Load the presets from the
  file, put in temporary structure. 2.  Convert this temporary structure to a
  "findem" dense structure 3.  Pass this dense structure to
  _papi_hwi_setup_all_presets for final assignment.  This change creates the
  final assignment directly without the intermediate two steps.

  * 8bc2bafd src/papi.c src/papi.h src/papi_common_strings.h...: Make the
  internal preset_info match the one exported by papi.h  There were a lot of
  cases where the same structure fields were available, just with different
  names.  That was confusing.  Also, this allows using a pointer to the preset
  info instead of having to copy values out of the structure when gathering
  event info for presets.

  * 8fda68cb src/genpapifdef.c src/papi.c src/papi_common_strings.h...: Merge
  the 4 separate preset structs into one.  _papi_hwi_presets was a structure
  containing pointers to 4 other arrays of structures which held the actual
  preset data.  This change merges all of these into one big structure.

2012-02-28  

  * e69815d7 src/linux-bgp.c src/papi_internal.c src/papi_internal.h...:
  Removing remaining vestiges of references to bipartite routines. Now the only
  references are in papi_bipartite.h, perfctr-x86.c and winpmc-p3.c.

  * 5766b641 src/papi_bipartite.h src/perfctr-x86.c
  src/win2k/substrate/winpmc-p3.c: These changes implement the bipartite
  allocation routine as a header file to be included in whatever cpu component
  needs it. Right now, that's just perfecter-x86 and windows. Both components
  have been modified and perfecter-86 compiles cleanly. Neither has been tested
  since I don't have access to a test bed.

  * 7f444b76 src/papi_libpfm_presets.c src/papi_preset.c src/papi_preset.h:
  Merge the hwi_dev_notes structure into hwi_preset_data

  * 21a1d197 src/components/vmware/vmware.c: add getenv

  * 08c1b474 src/perfctr-x86.c: Merge bipartite routine into perfecter-x86
  component, since this is effectively the only place it is used.

  * 9ed9b1f5 src/papi.c: Remove a reference to PAPI_set_event_info() which was
  removed for PAPI 4

  * c626f064 src/ctests/all_events.c src/ctests/derived.c
  src/ctests/kufrin.c...: Convert PAPI_event_info_t to separate preset event
  info  This moves the preset event info to its own separate structure, which
  reduces greatly the large string overhead that is not used by the native
  events.

  * 787d6822 src/perfctr-x86.c: Move bipartite stuff to perfctr_x86 since
  that's really the only place it's currently used.

  * 229c8b41 src/components/vmware/vmware.h: Add env_var definition to vmware.h

  * 46aaf6ca src/components/vmware/vmware.c: Remove all unneeded cases

  * 874a5718 src/freebsd.c src/perfctr-ppc64.c: Remove more unused references
  to .bpt_ routines in preparation for refactoring.

  * 74e5a5fd src/components/vmware/vmware.h: Remove uneeded defines from
  vmware.h header

  * 58b51367 src/components/coretemp_freebsd/coretemp_freebsd.c
  src/components/vmware/vmware.c src/solaris-niagara2.c...: Remove unused
  references to .bpt_ routines in preparation for refactoring.

2012-02-27  

  * 6b184158 src/Makefile.inc src/components/coretemp/linux-coretemp.c
  src/configure...: Have separate concept of "compiled-in" versus "active"
  components  With this change, the _papi_hwd[] component info array only
  contains a null-terminated list of _active_ components.  The
  _papi_compiled_components[] array has the original full list.  At
  init_substrate[] time a pointer to a component is only put in the _papi_hwd[]
  list if it is successfully initialized.  In addition the
  PAPI_num_compiled_components() and PAPI_get_compiled_component_info() calls
  have been added, but this is probably a confusing interface so they might
  only be temporary additions.

  * 042bfd5b src/Makefile.inc src/papi.c src/papi_data.c...: Split the contents
  of papi_data.c to various other files.  The data declarations in papi_data.c
  were mostly used in other files. Move these into more relevant locations.

  * 1877862c src/papiStdEventDefs.h src/papi_common_strings.h: Remove the BGL
  and BGP specific pre-defined events.  They can be better replaced by
  user-events, and we also had already removed BGL support completely a while
  back.  This removes some ifdefs from the pre-defined event list and keeps
  future pre-defined events from having different eventcodes on different
  platforms.

  * c3986b79 src/components/coretemp/linux-coretemp.c
  src/components/cuda/linux-cuda.c
  src/components/infiniband/linux-infiniband.c...: Add names and descriptions
  for components.  Also fixes cuda and lmsensors build issues introduced by
  vector.h cleanup

  * 2c84f920 src/aix.c src/freebsd.c src/perf_events.c...: Add names and
  descriptions to all of the CPU substrates.

  * 9f3e634a src/components/example/example.c src/papi.h src/utils/component.c:
  Add new "description" and "short_name" fields to .cmp_info structure  This
  description field allows components to provide extra information on what they
  do.  The short_name field will eventually be used to pre-pend event names. 
  The papi_component_avail utility has been updated to print the description. 
  The example component was updated to fill in these values.

  * ab61c9a7 src/Makefile.inc src/genpapifdef.c src/papi_common_strings.h...:
  Split papi_data.c into two parts  papi_data.c was half data structure
  definitions for all of PAPI and half string definitions used by both PAPI
  *and* genpapifdef  This splits the common string definitions to
  papi_common_strings.h so that genpapifdef can still be built w/o linking
  libpapi.a while making the code a lot easier to follow.

  * b8e6294c src/solaris-ultra.c: Remove unncessary extern declarations from
  solaris-ultra.c.

  * 5ddaff91 src/sys_perf_event_open.c: Remove unncessary extern declarations
  from sys_perf_event_open.c

  * a6c463b7 doc/Doxyfile-common.config: Create a common config file for
  doxygen.  As part of streamlining the doxygen process, this is a new template
  doxygen config files. This is a blank template file generated by doxygen
  1.7.4 (the version currently mandated by the release procedure )

  * dc2c11fa src/aix.c src/aix.h src/perfmon.c...: The vector pre-definition
  should be in the .c file, not the .h file

  * 0b3c83c3 src/perf_events.c: Remove unnecessary extern declarations in
  perf_events.c

  * b93efca0 src/perfmon.c src/perfmon.h: Remove unnecessary extern
  declarations in perfmon.c

  * 7f7a2359 src/papi_preset.c: Remove unnecessary extern declarations from
  papi_preset.c

  * ecec03ad src/papi_libpfm_presets.c: Remove extraneous extern declarations
  from papi_libpfm_presets.c

  * 7b5f3991 src/extras.c: remove extraneous extern declarations from extras.c

  * f6470e4d src/aix-memory.c src/aix.c src/aix.h: Remove unncessary extern
  declarations from aix.c

  * f197d4ab src/papi_data.h src/papi_internal.c: Remove unncessary extern
  declarations in papi_internal.c

  * e7b39d48 src/papi.c src/papi_data.c src/papi_data.h...: remove unnecessary
  extern definitions from papi.c

2012-02-24  

  * 92689f62 src/configure src/configure.in src/linux-common.c...: Add a
  --with-pthread-mutexes option to enable using pthread mutexes rather than
  PAPI custom locks  This is useful when running on new architectures that
  don't have a custom PAPI lock coded yet, and also for running valgrind
  deadlock detection utilities that only work with pthread based locking.

  * ca51ae67 src/papi_events.csv: Fix broken Pentium 4 Prescott support  We
  were missing the netbusrt_p declaration in papi_events.csv

  * f6460736 src/linux-common.c: Fix build on POWER, broken by the
  virtualization change.

  * 91d32585 src/perfctr-x86.c src/perfmon.c: Fix some warnings that have
  appeared due to recent changes.

  * ae0cf00f src/linux-common.c src/papi_libpfm3_events.c
  src/papi_libpfm4_events.c...: Clean up the Linux lock files  The locking
  primitives for some reason were spread among the libpfm code and the
  substrate codes.  This change moves them into linux-common and has them part
  of the OS code.  This way they will get properly initialized even if the perf
  counter or libpfm code isn't being used.

2012-02-23  

  * 88847e52 src/papi.c src/papi_memory.h: Remove _papi_cleanup_all_memory
  define from papi_memory.h  The code in papi_memory.h said:  /* define an
  alternate entry point for compatibility with papi.c for 3.1.x*/ /* this line
  should be deleted for the papi 4.0 head */  Since we are post papi-4.0 I
  thought it was time to act on this. Of course papi.c was still using the old
  name in one place.

  * 1d29dfc6 src/papi_libpfm_presets.c src/perfctr.c src/perfmon.c: Fix some
  missing includes found after the header cleanup.

  * b425a9f4 src/Makefile.inc src/extras.c src/extras.h...: Header file cleanup
   The papi_protos.h file contained a lot of no-longer in use exports.  I split
  up the ones that are still relevant to header files corresponding to the C
  file that the functions are defined in.

  * 07199b41 src/extras.c src/papi_vector.c src/papi_vector.h: Clean up the
  papi_vector code.  Remove things no longer being used, mark static functions
  as static.

  * d7496311 src/linux-common.c src/x86_cpuid_info.c src/x86_cpuid_info.h: Fix
  a missing "return 1" which meant that the virtualization flag wasn't being
  set right.  With this fix, on saturn-vm1 we now get:  Running in a VM        
   : yes VM Vendor:               : VMwareVMware  in the papi_native_avail
  header

  * 8da36222 src/freebsd.c src/linux-bgp.c src/papi.c...: Remove the
  ->add_prog_event function vector  As far as I can tell this is a PAPI 2.0
  remnant that was never properly removed.  This also removes
  PAPI_add_pevent(), PAPI_save(), and PAPI_restore(), none of which were
  exported in papi.h so in theory no one could have been using them.  Also
  removes _papi_hwi_add_pevent()

  * a5f3c8b5 src/aix.c src/freebsd.c src/linux-timer.c...: Reduce the usage of
  MY_VECTOR whenever possible.  This is an attempt to make the cpu-counter
  components to be as similar as possible to external components.

  * abbcbf29 src/any-null.h: Missed removing any-null.h during the any-null
  removal.

  * 665d4c5c src/linux-common.c: Somehow missed an include during the
  virtualization addition.

  * 0c06147b src/perfctr-2.6.x/usr.lib/event_set_centaur.os
  src/perfctr-2.6.x/usr.lib/event_set_p5.os
  src/perfctr-2.6.x/usr.lib/event_set_p6.os: Removes the last of the binary
  files from perfctr2.6.x  Some binary files were left out in the cold after a
  mishap trying to configure perfctr for the build test.

  * 3acb7d57 src/Makefile.inc src/configure src/configure.in...: Add support
  for reporting if we are running in a virtualized environment to the
  PAPI_hw_info_t structure.  This currently only works on x86.  it works by
  looking at bit 31 of ecx after a cpuid (the "in a VM" bit) and then using
  leaf 0x40000000 to get the name of the VM software (this works for VMware and
  Xen at least)  x86_cache_info.c was renamed to x86_cpuid_info.c to better
  reflect what goes on in that file (it does various things based on the cpuid
  instruction).  the testlib header was updated to report virtualization status
  in the papi header (printed for things like papi_native_avail).

2012-02-22  

  * 9c7659b5 src/Makefile.inc src/freq.c: Remove the freq.c file as nothing
  seemed to be using it.

  * d205e2d3 src/perfctr-x86.c: Made a stupid typo when converting perfctr to
  call libpfm functions with the component id.

  * 25b41779 src/papi_libpfm3_events.c src/papi_libpfm4_events.c
  src/papi_libpfm_events.h...: When updating the preset code to take a
  component index I missed a few callers.

  * a713ffb1 src/papi_internal.c src/papi_vector.c: Remove any-null component

  * 27e1c2c5 src/any-null-memory.c src/any-null.c src/any-proc-null.c...:
  Remove the any-null component.

  * 25779ae0 PAPI_FAQ.html: Saving another version of the FAQ after adding a
  git section, and removing several obsolete sections. These questions still
  need detailed review for relevance and timeliness.

  * 449a1a61 src/ctests/overflow_allcounters.c: Fix overflow_allcounters which
  was making assumptions about component 0 existing.

  * f21be742 src/ctests/hwinfo.c: Make the hwinfo test not bail out if no
  counters are available.

  * ebc675e6 src/ctests/memory.c: Make sure the memory ctest runs even if no
  components are available.

  * 9b3de551 src/linux-common.c src/perf_events.c src/perfmon-ia64.c...: Make
  sure the system info init happens at os init time.  Otherwise the system info
  never gets set if a perfcounter component isn't available.

  * 59e47e12 src/papi_internal.c: Make sure that _papi_hwi_assign_eventset()
  does the right thing if no components are available.

  * dd51e5d6 src/ctests/api.c: The api test would fail in the no cpu component
  case.  Fix it to properly check for errors before attempting to run
  high-level PAPI tests.

  * 069e9d2f src/aix.c src/papi.c src/papi_internal.h...: Fix code that was
  depending on _papi_hwd[0] existing.  Most of this was in the presets code. 
  The preset code had many assumptions so that you can only code presets with
  component[0]. This fixes some of them by passing the component index around.

  * 7259eaec src/papi_vector.c: Fix up papi_vector to get rid of some warnings
  introduced on AIX.

  * 16fe0a61 src/aix.c src/solaris-ultra.c: Fix two last substrates where I
  missed some fields in the OS structure conversion.

  * 625871ec src/perfmon.c: Missed a cmp_info field in perfmon.c

  * 680919d9 PAPI_FAQ.html: Saving the latest version of the FAQ before
  undertaking major revisions.

  * 3d4fa2e5 src/linux-timer.c src/perfctr-x86.h: Fix the perfctr code to
  compile if configured with --with-virtualtimer=perfctr

  * bbd7871f src/perfctr.c: Missed two OS vector calls in the perfctr code
  during the conversion.

  * bc6d1713 src/Makefile.inc: Removed one of the two instances of MISCOBJS
  listed in Makefile.inc.

2012-02-21  

  * 40bc4c57 src/papi_vector.c src/papi_vector.h: Remove now-unused OS vectors
  from the main papi vector table.

  * 3c6a0f7b src/aix.c src/freebsd.c src/linux-bgp.c...: Convert PAPI to use
  the _papi_os_vector for the operating-system specific function vectors.

  * 568abad5 src/papi_vector.h: Add new _papi_os_vector structure to hold
  operating-system specific function vectors.

  * a39d2373 src/ctests/subinfo.c: Missed removing a field from the subinfo
  ctest.

  * 1d930868 src/papi.h: Remove fields now in PAPI_os_info_t from the
  component_info_t struct.

  * d397d74a src/components/example/example.c: Remove fields now in
  PAPI_os_info_t from the example component.

  * 8cd5c8e0 src/aix.c src/freebsd.c src/linux-bgp.c...: Modify all the
  substrates to use _papi_os_info. instead of _papi_hwd[0]->cmp_info for the
  values moved to the OS struct

  * 58855d3a src/papi_internal.h: Add padding for future expansion to
  PAPI_os_info_t  Add _papi_hwi_init_os(void); definition

  * ea1930e1 src/papi_internal.h: Add new PAPI_os_info_t structure to
  papi_internal.h

  * 0eac1b29 src/utils/multiplex_cost.c: Modify multiplex_cost to properly use
  the API_get_opt() interface to get itimer data, rather than directly
  accessing the fields from the cmp_info structure.  This would have broken
  after the OS split.

  * 87c2aa2f src/ctests/subinfo.c: subinfo was printing itimer data from the
  cmpinfo structure.  These values will not be in cmpinfo once the OS split
  happens.

  * f2c62d50 src/components/vmware/vmware.h: Clean up the VMware Header a bit

2012-02-17  

  * 6f0c1230 src/aix.c src/components/coretemp/linux-coretemp.c
  src/components/coretemp_freebsd/coretemp_freebsd.c...: The git conversion
  reset all of the CVS $Id$ lines to just $Id$  Since we depend on the $Id$
  lines for the component names, I had to go back and fix all of them to be the
  component names again.

  * 2d208d0e src/perfctr-2.6.x/usr.lib/event_set_centaur.o
  src/perfctr-2.6.x/usr.lib/event_set_p5.o
  src/perfctr-2.6.x/usr.lib/event_set_p6.o: Remove a few binary files in
  perfctr-2.6.x

  * f78bf1af src/libpfm-3.y/Makefile src/libpfm-3.y/README
  src/libpfm-3.y/docs/Makefile...: More cleanups from the migration, latest
  version of libpfm-3.y perfctr-2.[6,7]  Version numbers got really confused in
  cvs and the git cvsimport didn't know that eg 1.1.1.28 > 1.1 ( see
  perfctr-2.6.x/CHANGES revision 1.1.1.28.6.1 :~)

  * e8aa2e61 INSTALL.txt: Explicitly state that 3.7 was the last version of
  PAPI with good windows support.

  * 546901fa src/components/cuda/linux-cuda.c: Modified CUDA component so that
  a PAPI version - that was configured with CUDA - will successfully build on a
  machine that does not have GPUs.

2012-02-16  

  * 49d9f71c src/.gitignore: Add a .gitignore file with the files that PAPI
  autogenerates.  This way they won't clutter up "git status" messages
