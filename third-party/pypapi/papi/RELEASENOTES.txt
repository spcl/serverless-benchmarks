PAPI 5.5.0 RELEASE NOTES                                            14 Sep 2016
===============================================================================

PAPI 5.5 is now available. This release provide a new component that
provides read and write access to the information and controls exposed
via the Linux powercap interface.The PAPI powercap component supports
measuring and capping power usage on recent Intel architectures.[a][b]

We have added core support for Knights Landing (uncore support will be
released later) as well as power monitoring via the RAPL and powercap
components.

For specific and detailed information on changes made in this release,
see ChangeLogP550.txt for keywords of interest or go directly to the
PAPI git repo.

New Platforms:
* Added  Knights Landing (KNL) core events and preset events.
* Added Intel Broadwell/Skylake/Knights Landing RAPL support
* Updated PAPI preset event support for Intel Broadwell/Skylake

New Component: 
* Powercap component: PAPI now supports the Linux Power Capping
  Framework which exposes power capping devices and power measurement
  to user space via a sysfs virtual file system interface.

Enhancements:
* Add support for multiple flavors of POWER8 processors.
* Force all processors to check event schedulability by checking that
  PAPI can successfully read the counters.
* Support for Intel Broadwell-EP, Skylake, Goldmont, Haswell-EP
  inherited from libpfm4.
* Shared memory object (.so) naming is made more limited so that minor
  updates do not break ABI compatibility.

Bug Fixes:
* Improve testlib error messages if a component fails to initialize.
* Fix _papi_hwi_postfix_calc parsing and robustness.
* Clean build rules for CUDA sampling subcomponent.
* Correct IBM Power7 and Power8 computation of PAPI_L1_DCA.
* Eliminate the sole use of ftests_skip subroutine.
* Correct the event string names for tenth.c.  
* Have Fortran test support code report errors more clearly.
* Cleanup output from libmsr component.
* PAPI internal functions were marked as static to avoid exposing them
  externally.
* Multiple component were fixed to make internal functions static
  where possible, to avoid exposing the functions as externally
  accessible entry points.
* CUDA component configuration bug fixed.

the ChangeLogP421.txt file for keywords of interest or go directly to the PAPI
cvs tree.

GENERAL NOTES
===============================================================================

RECENT CHANGES IN PAPI 4.2.1
===============================================================================
Bug Fixes:
----------
	* solaris substrate set_domain call was added.
	* multiplexing math errors were fixed in perf_events.c
	* more multiplexing read path errors were identified and fixed
	* src/linux-timer.c: Fix compilation warning if you specify
	  --with-walltime=gettimeofday
	* src/linux-timer.c: Fix the build on Linux systems using mmtimer
	* src/linux-common.c: Update the linux MHz detection code to use
	  bogoMIPS when there is no MHz field available in /proc/cpuinfo.
	* src/: configure, configure.in: Fix a typo in the perfctr section;
	  it was causing a machine to default to perfctr when it had no
	  performance interface.  ( a centos vm image with a 2.6.18 kernel)
	  Also checks that we actually have perfctr if we specify
	  --with-perfctr.
	* Fix SMP ARM issues reported by Harald Servat.
	  Also, adds proper header dependency checking in the Rules files.
	* src/ctests/api.c: Make the api test actually test PAPI_flops() as
	  it claims to do, rather than PAPI_flips().
	* src/papi_events.csv: Update the coreduo (not core2) events.  Most
	  notably the FP events were wrong.
	* src/papi_events.csv: Modify Intel Sandybridge PAPI_FP_OPS and
	  PAPI_FP_INS events to not count x87 fp instructions.
	  The problem is that the current predefines were made by adding 5
	  events.  With the NMI watchdog stealing an event and/or
	  hyperthreading reducing the number of available counters by half,
	  we just couldn't fit.
	  This now raises the potential for people using x87-compiled
	  floating point on Sandybridge and getting 0 FP_OPS.  This is only
	  likely if running a 32-bit kernel and *not* compiling your code
	  with -msse.
	  A long-term solution might be trying to find a better set of FP
	  predefines for sandybridge.
	* src/components/lmsensors/: Rules.lmsensors, configure.in: Fixed
	  configure error message and rules link error for shared object
	  linking. Thanks Will Cohen.
	* src/components/lmsensors/linux-lmsensors.h: Added missing string
	  header
	* src/components/net/tests/: net_values_by_code.c,
	  net_values_by_name.c: Apply patch suggested by Will Cohen to
	  check for system return values.
	* src/Makefile.inc: Patch to cleanup dependencies, allowing for
	  parallel makes.  Patch due to Will Cohen from redhat
	* src/: papi_internal.c, threads.c: Fix two race
	  conditions that are probably the cause of the pthrtough
	  double-free error.
	  When freeing a thread, we remove and free all eventsets belonging
	  to that thread.  This could race with the thread itself removing
	  the evenset, causing some ESI fields to be freed twice.
	  The problem was found by using the Valgrind 3.8 Helgrind tool
	    valgrind --tool=helgrind --free-is-write=yes ctests/pthrtough
	  In order for Helgrind to work, I had to temporarily modify PAPI
	  to use POSIX pthread mutexes for locking.

Enhancements:
-------------
	* general doxygen cleanups
	* cleanup output of overflow_allcounters for clarity in debugging
	* updates to most recent (as of Feb 1) libpfm4
	* remove now-opaque event codes from papi_native_avail
	  and papi_xml_event_info
	* src/: papi_internal.c Update the component initialization code 
	  so that it can handle a PAPI ERROR return gracefully.  Previously 
	  there was no way to indicate initialization failure besides just 
	  setting num_native_events to 0.
	 
New Platforms:
-------------
 	* src/libpfm4/lib/: pfmlib_amd64_fam11h.c, events/amd64_events_fam11h.h
	  Support for AMD Family 11.
	* src/libpfm4/lib/: pfmlib_amd64_fam12h.c, events/amd64_events_fam12h.h
	  Support for AMD Family 12.
	
Deprecated Platforms:
---------------------
	* remove obsolete ACPI component
	
New / Improved Components:
---------------
	* PAPI CUDA component updated for CUDA / CUPTI 4.1.
		* SetCudaDevice() now works with the latest CUDA 4.1 version.
		* Auto-detection of CUDA version for backward compatibility.
		* PAPI_read() now accumulates event values. This fixes a bug
		in earlier versions.
	* extensive updates and cleanups to the example and coretemp components.
	* significant updates of lustre, and mx components
	* The linux net component underwent extensive updates and cleanups.
  	  In particular, it nows dynamically detects the network
	  interface names [1] and export 16 counters for each interface
  	  (see also src/components/net/{CHANGES,README}).

Open Issues:
-------------
	* multiplex1.c was rewritten to expose a multiplexing bug in the perf_events
	kernel (3.0.3) for MIPS
	* src/components/lmsensors/: Latest versions of lmsensors are incompatible
	  with current lmsensors component. Interface needs to be updated for forward
	  compatibility.
	* There's a problem with broken overflow on POWER6 linux systems.
	  We suspect a kernel problem, but don't know exactly which version(s)
	  We're running a 2.6.36 kernel where the problem has been identified.
	  It may be fixed in newer versions.

Experimental:
-------------
	* a new vmware component has been added to report a variety of soft events
	  when running as a guest in a VMWare environment

GENERAL NOTES
===============================================================================
This is a major release of PAPI-C. It add a significant new feature in 
user-defined events. It also marks a shift from external (and out-dated) 
man pages to doxygen generated man pages. These pages can be found online at:
http://icl.cs.utk.edu/papi/docs/. They are also installable with "make install", 
and you can build your own versions using doxygen.

RECENT CHANGES IN PAPI 4.2.0
===============================================================================
Bug Fixes:
----------
	* Bug in CUDA v4.0 fixed. It caused a threaded application to hang when 
	  parent called cuInit() before fork() and child called also cuInit().
	  All fork ctests pass now if papi is configured with cuda component. 
	* If papi is configured with cuda component and running a threaded 
	  application, we need to make sure that a thread doesn't free the same 
	  memory location(s) more than once. Now all pthread ctests pass with cuda.
	* ctests/thrspecific works now with the CUDA component
	* Added CudaRemoveEvent functionality (broken in earlier CUDA RC versions). 
	* ctests/all_native_events works now for the default CUDA device.
	* Add locking to papi_pfm4_events so that adding/looking up event names 
	  doesn't have a race condition when multiple threads are doing it at once.
	* Fixed a series of problems with Itanium builds.
	* Set FD_CLOEXEC on the overflow signal handler fd. Otherwise if we exec()
	  with overflow enabled, the exec'd process will quickly die due to lack 
	  of signal handler. This patch is needed due to a change in behavior in 
	  Linux 3.0. Mark Krentel first noticed this problem.
	* Recent Ubuntu versions use the ld flag --as-needed by default, which
	  breaks the PAPI configure step for the libdl check, as the
	  --as-needed flag enforces the rule that libraries must come after the 
	  object files on the command line, not before. The fix for this is to put 
	  the libdl check it in LIBS instead of in LDFLAGS.
	* Removed an fopen() without an fclose() on /proc/cpuinfo in papi.c. 
	  This was being done to set the event masks properly for itanium and p4.
	  Since the platform code sets CPU vendor and family for us we don't
	  really have to open cpuinfo.  This fix may also work on non-Linux 
	  systems too.
	* Update papi.h to properly detect if being built with a C99 compiler.

Enhancements:
-------------
	* Default support for libpfm4
	* ./configure --with-libpfm3 to support legacy libpfm3 builds
	* PERF_COUNT_SW software events are available under perf_events with 
	  libpfm4
	* Nehalem/Westmere/SandyBridge Offcore event support is ready, 
	  but support is not yet available in the Linux kernel.
	* Add new utility to display PAPI error codes and description strings.
	* Add API to access error descriptions: PAPI_descr_error( int error_code).
	* Add support for handling multiattach properly.
	* Cleanups to avoid gcc-4.6 warnings.
	* Added ability to add tests to components. All component tests are
	  compiled with PAPI when typing 'make'and cleaned up with 'make clean' 
	  or 'make clobber'. Also added tests to the example and cuda components.
	* CUDA component is now thread-safe. Multiple CPU
	  threads can access the same CUDA context. Note, it's possible to
	  create a different CUDA context for each thread, but then we are
	  likely running into a limitation that only one context can be
	  profiled at a time.
	* LOTS of code cleanup thanks to Will Cohen of RedHat.
	* Refactored test code so no-cpu-counters can build with components
	* Build all utilities with no-cpu-counters
	* Modify run_tests.sh so that you can set the VALGRIND command 
	  externally via environment variable without having to edit 
	  run_tests.sh itself. Also adds Date and cpuinfo information to the 
	  beginning of run_tests.sh results.  This can help when run_tests.sh 
	  output is passed around when debugging a problem.
	* Parallel make now works.
	  
New Platforms:
-------------
	* AMD Family 14h Bobcat (libpfm4 only)
	* Intel SandyBridge (libpfm4 only)
	* ARM Cortex-A8 and Cortex-A9 (libpfm4 only)
	
Deprecated Platforms:
---------------------
	* although still technically supported, we are no longer actively testing
	  platforms based on the perfmon and perfctr patches. All linux kernels
	  > 2.6.32 provide internal support for perf_events.
	
New / Improved Components:
---------------
	* Add a number of 'native' events to the component info structure in 
	  example component.
	* Introduce a papi_component_avail utility; lists the components we were
	  built with, optionally with native/preset counts and version number.

Open Issues:
-------------
	* On newer Linux kernels (2.6.34+) the nmi_watchdog counter can	steal one
	  of the counters, reducing by one the total available.
	  There's a bug in Linux where if you try to use the full number of
	  counters on such a system with a group leader, the sys_perf_open()
	  call will succeed only to fail at read time.
	  (instead of the proper error code at open time).
	  I do wish there were a way to notify the user more visibly,
	  because losing a counter (when you might only have 4 total to
	  begin with) is a big deal, and most Linux vendors are starting to
	  ship kernels with the nmi_watchdog enabled.

Experimental:
-------------
	* Preliminary support for MIPS 74K.

http://icl.cs.utk.edu/projects/papi/wiki/Main_Page
And visit the PAPI website for the latest updates:
http://icl.cs.utk.edu/papi/


CHANGES IN PAPI 4.1.3 SINCE PAPI 4.1.2
===============================================================================
Bug Fixes:
----------
	* Fixed a linux-timer.c compile error that only shows up on PPC.
	* Fixed ctests/all_native_events.c:
	  It failed when PAPI was built with several components because the 
	  eventset failed to add events that were not from the first component.
	* Redefined PAPI_FP_OPS for Nehalem; Now counts properly for 32-bit code.
	* Uncovered and resolved bugs in attaching to fork/exec'd code.
	* Reworked eventset cleanup code to avoid an error situation in perf_events
	  where events were being removed from a terminated attached process.
	* Fixed a configure bug preventing non-default bitmode builds of perf_event
	  versions of PAPI.

	
Enhancements:
-------------
	* consolidated a bunch of duplicated linux code into "linux-xxx.c" files.
	* Split WIN32 specific code out from linux common code.
	* Renamed various perfctr functions to be _perfctr_ rather than _linux_.
	* Added function pointer destroy_eventset to the PAPI vector table.
	  Needed for the CUDA Component.
	* PAPI_assign_eventset_component now refuses to reassign components.
	* Implemented inherit feature for perf_events. Thanks to Gary Mohr.
	* Added a case to utils/cost.c to test for processing derived events.
	* Added utils/multiplex_cost.c.
	* Added --with-assumed-kernel to configure
	
New Platforms:
-------------
	* POWER7 / AIX support is now available (see Known Bugs below)
	* Intel Westmere for perfctr.
	* AMD Family 15h (Interlagos) and 10h RevE processors.

---------------
	* NVidia CUDA: still in pre-release until NVidia releases official CUDA4.
	
Open Issues:
-------------
	* Currently using PAPI_attach() to attach to multiple processes at the same
	  time will not work.  On the perf_events substrate this may fail with a 
	  PAPI_EISRUN error for the subsequent attaches.  On other substrates the
	  additional attaches may work but results read back will be invalid.
	  This behavior will be fixed in a subsequent PAPI release.

Experimental:
-------------
	* libpfm4 support is experimentally available but subject to change

Known Bugs:
-----------
	* POWER7 / AIX has some known bugs in this version:
		* PAPI_FP_OPS overcounts by 50% in many cases
		* multiplexing does not work correctly
		* memory limits for threaded tests are causing problems

CHANGES IN PAPI 4.1.1 SINCE PAPI 4.1.0
===============================================================================
Bug Fixes:
----------
    * resolved confusion in event table naming for Intel Core, Core2 and Core
      Duo processors; cleaned up Nehalem and Westmere event definitions.
	* the --with-no-cpu-counters function and timing functions for AIX
	  were fixed.
	* compiler flags for AIX Fortran were fixed.
	* doc directory is now preserved to prevent 'make clean' from entering an
	  ininite loop.
	* prevent passing -Wextra to libpfm build, which was throwing errors in
	  that build under certain circumstances.
	* fix a subtle problem in multiplexing in which final counter values could
	  be under-reported. Changes the behavior of PAPI_stop when multiplexing.
	  See the ChangeLog for further details.
	
Enhancements:
-------------
	* now supports attach/detach for perf_events, thanks to Gary Mohr.
	* update cache information for recent Intel x86 processors.
	* F_SETOWN_EX was implemented in perf_events to guarantee that each
	  process recieves it's own interrupts. This fixes a bug in high
	  interrupt rates reported by Rice.
	* perf_events checks permissions at configuration rather than at start.
	  Thanks to Gary Mohr.
	* Pentium IV now supported under perf_events in kernel 2.6.35
	* add a WARNING for tests cases that don't fail but have issues
	  that may need to be addressed.
	* add OS kernel version to component info struct; useful for enabling /
	  diabling features in PAPI based on kernel version
	* updated to terminal release (3.10) of libpfm.

PAPI 4.1.0 RELEASE NOTES                                            22 Jun 2010
===============================================================================
For specific and detailed information on changes made in this release, grep

cvs tree.


GENERAL NOTES
===============================================================================
This is the second release of Component PAPI, or PAPI-C. See other references
to PAPI-C, including the description in this file under PAPI 4.0.0 for details 
on the differences between Classic PAPI and PAPI-C.

This release includes significant code cleanup to eliminate compiler warnings
and type inconsistencies and to eliminate memory leaks.

We also now support embedded doxygen comments for documentation. See the PAPI
website for more details.

The component build environment has been restructured to make it easier to add
and build components without modifying baseline PAPI code. See 
/src/components/README for details.

http://icl.cs.utk.edu/projects/papi/wiki/Main_Page
And visit the PAPI website for the latest updates:
http://icl.cs.utk.edu/papi/


CHANGES IN PAPI 4.1.0 SINCE PAPI 4.0.0
===============================================================================
Bug Fixes:
----------
    * configure was mis-identifying some Pentium 4 processors
    * the ctests/shlib test now tests against the shared math library, libm.so,
      instead of libpapi.so, which works more predictably with library renaming.
    * multiplexing was silently returning without setting multiplex TRUE in 
      cases where no event had been assigned to an eventset. An event must be
      added to an eventset or PAPI_assign_eventset_component() must be called
      before multiplexing can be enabled. This silent error has been removed. 
    * the perfmon and perf_events counter interfaces were not properly handling 
      event unit masks. This has been fixed.
    * PAPI_name_to_code() was not exiting properly in certain circumstances, 
      failing on events where there should have been a match. This is corrected.
    * a serious but insidious bug in the overflow logic was corrected. This bug 
      would only show up when PAPI_overflow was called between calls to 
      PAPI_add_event. Overflow would only be set for the last call of 
      PAPI_overflow. This has  been corrected.
	* IBM Blue Gene P systems were corrupting stack frames and crashing when the
	  papi_get_event_info call was executed. This has been fixed.
	* The PAPI cycles event was not working for IBM Blue Gene P. This is fixed.
	* papi_native_avail was exiting improperly when using the -e option. 
	  This caused problems with batch execution systems (like Blue Gene P). 
	  This has been fixed.
	* a significant number of memory leaks have been purged.
	* compiler warning flags have been tightened and a range of warnings have
	  been eliminated.
	* removed implicit type conversions in prototypes.
	

Enhancements:
-------------
	* the utils/papi_version utility now reports four digits where the last digit
	  matches the patch number.
	* Pentium II and Athlon now use libpfm for event decoding like all other x86
	  platforms.
	* Doxygen documentation has been added to the API and components.
	* Component compilation has been completely restructured. See
	  /papi/src/components/README for details.
	* PAPI can now be compiled with a no-cpu-counters option.
	

New Platforms:
-------------
	* the ultrasparc architecture has been resurrected
	* freebsd support was migrated from PAPI 3.7
	* Intel Nehalem EX and Westmere support has been added
	
Deprecated Platforms:
---------------------
	* IBM BG/L has been deprecated.
	* POWER 3 and POWER4 have been deprecated

New Components:
---------------
	* Infiniband: Experimental
	* Lustre: Experimental

PAPI 4.0.0 RELEASE NOTES                                            19 Jan 2010
===============================================================================
For specific and detailed information on changes made in this release, grep
the ChangeLogP400.txt file for keywords of interest or go directly to the PAPI
cvs tree.


GENERAL NOTES
===============================================================================
This is the inaugural release of Component PAPI, or PAPI-C. It represents a 
significant architectural change from PAPI 3.7.x and earlier. As such, your 
application must be recompiled and relinked to libpapi, the PAPI library for 
this version to work.
PAPI-C is backward compatible with earlier versions of PAPI. All new library 
features are supported through new APIs and all old APIs still work as expected.
Applications instrumented for PAPI should continue to work as expected with no
changes.
The major change in PAPI-C is the support of multiple components, or counting 
domains, in addition to the traditional hardware counters found in the cpu. The
goal of this first release of PAPI-C is to provide a stable technology platform
within which to explore the development and implementation of additional
components.
Although a small number of components are provided with this release, the major
objective has been to guarantee that PAPI-C works at least as well as earlier
PAPI releases and on the same range of hardware platforms. We think we have 
achieved that goal.

CHANGES IN PAPI 4.0.0 SINCE PAPI 3.7.2
===============================================================================
Bug Fixes:
----------

Enhancements:
-------------
- The perf_events linux kernel interface is supported for POWER and x86 in 
  linux kernels 2.6.31 and above.
- PAPI info now includes information on multicore heirarchy. This is reported
  in the header of many tests.

New Platforms:
-------------
- IBM Blue Gene P has been fully integrated into the code base. It still
  suffers the same quirks and limitations as the earlier pre-release.

Open Issues:
-------------
- Components are invoked from the configure line; Requires PAPI source code
  modifications to add new components.

Experimental:
-------------

Known Bugs:
-----------
- some tests involving overflow and profiling fail with linux perf_events
- multiple event overflow only works for last event enabled on (at least)
  Intel Core2 and Itanium architectures.
- clock speeds on variable speed Intel systems can be misreported, leading to 
  incorrect calculations of mflops
- memory leaks may lead to (rare) seg faults on Pentium4 systems

GENERAL NOTES
===============================================================================
This release is an incremental upgrade to PAPI 3.7.0. It cleans up several 
issues found in the 3.7.0 release and provides better support for the 
perf_counter interface introduced in Linux kernel 2.6.31.

As always, if you identify strange behavior or reproducible bugs, please
contact the PAPI team or visit the PAPI User Forum.

And visit the PAPI website for the latest updates:
http://icl.cs.utk.edu/papi/

NOTE: If you are looking for the man pages and other user documentation, look
online. We decided we could provide better and more timely support by 
maintaining just the online documentation. Let us know if you think this is a
bad decision.


CHANGES IN PAPI 3.7.1 SINCE PAPI 3.7.0
===============================================================================
Bug Fixes:
----------
- fixed long standing subtle multiplexing bug in which TIDs and PIDs would get
  confused. TIDs would then get lost leading to long term instability.
- fixed unit mask handling in perf_counters
- fixed uninitialized string issue in /proc/cpuinfo parsing
- fixed event reporting errors for various Opteron Family 10h models

Enhancements:
-------------
- FreeBSD support for Intel i7
- cleaned up libpapi.so naming for RedHat rpms
- cleaned up various other issues for rpms per RedHat
- autodetection of 2.6.31 perf_counter interface (in most cases)
- enhanced packaging options in configure to support building either static or 
  shared libraries independently

New Platforms:
-------------
- Support for the perf_counters (PCL: Performance Counters for Linux) interface
  for Linux kernel 2.6.31 and later has been more completely tested on a 
  broader range of platforms, including Opteron, Core2, i7, and POWER.
  It successfully performs basic counting operations and handles many multiplex,
  overflow and profiling situations. It is still not as extensivelytested as the
  perfmon or perfctr interfaces, but is ready for work. Caveat Emptor.

Major Issues:
-------------
- see 3.7.0

Experimental:
-------------

Known Bugs:
-----------
- see 3.7.0

===============================================================================
For specific and detailed information on changes made in this release, grep
the ChangeLogP370.txt file for keywords of interest or go directly to the PAPI
cvs tree.


GENERAL NOTES
===============================================================================
This release is a recommended upgrade to PAPI 3.6.x. It addresses a number of 
open issues and introduces support for several new platforms, including Intel
Nehalem (Core i7), Atom, POWER7 and Niagara2.

If you are currently using PAPI 3.6.x or earlier, it is recommended that you 
upgrade to this version.

As always, if you identify strange behavior or reproducible bugs, please
contact the PAPI team or the PAPI User Forum.

http://icl.cs.utk.edu/papi/

NOTE: If you are looking for the man pages and other user documentation, look
online. We decided we could provide better and more timely support by 
maintaining just the online documentation. Let us know if you think this is a
bad decision.


CHANGES IN PAPI 3.7.0 SINCE PAPI 3.6.2
===============================================================================
Bug Fixes:
----------

  PAPI_DP_OPS - counts double precision scalar and vector FP operations
  PAPI_SP_OPS - counts single precision scalar and vector FP operations
  PAPI_VEC_DP - counts double precision vector instructions
  PAPI_VEC_SP - counts single precision vector instructions
- FreeBSD support upgrade and new support for Atom and Intel Core2

New Platforms:
-------------
- Intel Core i7 (Nehalem) support for 7 core counters; no support for 
  Uncore counters

-------------
- PAPI for Windows does not support 64-bit versions due to compiler issues.

Experimental:
-------------
- Support for the perf_counters (PCL: Performance Counters for Linux) interface
  is available as a technology pre-release for Linux kernel 2.6.31 and later.
  This has been tested on IBM POWER and Intel Core2 and successfully performs 
  basic counting operations. It has not been stress tested. Caveat Emptor.

Known Bugs:
-----------
- clock speeds are occasionally not reported correctly for systems with
  SpeedStep technology.
- Intel Atom crashes on a small number of standard tests.
