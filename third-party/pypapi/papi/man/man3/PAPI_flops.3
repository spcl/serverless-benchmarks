\fBParameters:\fP
.RS 4
\fI*rtime\fP total realtime since the first call 
.br
\fI*ptime\fP total process time since the first call 
.br
\fI*flpops\fP total floating point operations since the first call 
.br
\fI*mflops\fP incremental (Mega) floating point operations per seconds since the last call
.RE
.PP
\fBReturn values:\fP
.RS 4
\fIPAPI_EINVAL\fP The counters were already started by something other than \fBPAPI_flops()\fP\&. 
.br
\fIPAPI_ENOEVNT\fP The floating point operations event does not exist\&. 
.br
\fIPAPI_ENOMEM\fP Insufficient memory to complete the operation\&.
.RE
.PP
The first call to \fBPAPI_flops()\fP will initialize the PAPI High Level interface, set up the counters to monitor the PAPI_FP_OPS event and start the counters\&.
.PP
Subsequent calls will read the counters and return total real time, total process time, total floating point operations since the start of the measurement and the Mflop/s rate since latest call to \fBPAPI_flops()\fP\&. A call to \fBPAPI_stop_counters()\fP will stop the counters from running and then calls such as \fBPAPI_start_counters()\fP or other rate calls can safely be used\&.
.PP
\fBPAPI_flops\fP returns information related to theoretical floating point operations rather than simple instructions\&. It uses the PAPI_FP_OPS event which attempts to 'correctly' account for, e\&.g\&., FMA undercounts and FP Store overcounts, etc\&.
