.SH NAME
PAPI_num_cmp_hwctrs \- 
.PP
Return the number of hardware counters for the specified component\&.  

.SH SYNOPSIS
.br
.PP
.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 
\fBPAPI_num_cmp_hwctrs()\fP returns the number of counters present in the specified component\&. By convention, component 0 is always the cpu\&.
.PP
On some components, especially for CPUs, the value returned is a theoretical maximum for estimation purposes only\&. It might not be possible to easily create an EventSet that contains the full number of events\&. This can be due to a variety of reasons: 1)\&. Some CPUs (especially Intel and POWER) have the notion of fixed counters that can only measure one thing, usually cycles\&. 2)\&. Some CPUs have very explicit rules about which event can run in which counter\&. In this case it might not be possible to add a wanted event even if counters are free\&. 3)\&. Some CPUs halve the number of counters available when running with SMT (multiple CPU threads) enabled\&. 4)\&. Some operating systems 'steal' a counter to use for things such as NMI Watchdog timers\&. The only sure way to see if events will fit is to attempt adding events to an EventSet, and doing something sensible if an error is generated\&.
.PP
\fBPAPI_library_init()\fP must be called in order for this function to return anything greater than 0\&.

.RS 4
On success, this function returns a value greater than zero\&.
