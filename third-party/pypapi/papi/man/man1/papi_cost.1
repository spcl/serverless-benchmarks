papi_cost [-dhs] [-b bins] [-t threshold]
.SH "Description"
.PP
papi_cost is a PAPI utility program that computes the min / max / mean / std\&. deviation of execution times for PAPI start/stop pairs and for PAPI reads\&. This information provides the basic operating cost to a user's program for collecting hardware counter data\&. Command line options control display capabilities\&.
