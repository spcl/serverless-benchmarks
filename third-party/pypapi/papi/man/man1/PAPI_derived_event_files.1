.SH NAME
PAPI_derived_event_files \- Describes derived event definition file syntax\&.
.SH "Derived Events"
.PP
PAPI provides the ability to define events whose value will be derived from multiple native events\&. The list of native events to be used in a derived event and a formula which describes how to use them is provided in an event definition file\&. The PAPI team provides an event definition file which describes all of the supported PAPI preset events\&. PAPI also allows a user to provide an event definition file that describes a set of user defined events which can extend the events PAPI normally supports\&.
.PP
This page documents the syntax of the commands which can appear in an event definition file\&.

.SS "Commands:"
\fBCPU,<pmuName>\fP
.RS 4
Specifies a PMU name which controls if the PRESET and EVENT commands that follow this line should be processed\&. Multiple CPU commands can be entered without PRESET or EVENT commands between them to provide a list of PMU names to which the derived events that follow will apply\&. When a PMU name provided in the list matches a PMU name known to the running system, the events which follow will be created\&. If none of the PMU names provided in the list match a PMU name on the running system, the events which follow will be ignored\&. When a new CPU command follows either a PRESET or EVENT command, the PMU list is rebuilt\&.

.SS "Notes:"
The PRESET command has traditionally been used in the PAPI provided preset definition file\&. The EVENT command is intended to be used in user defined event definition files\&. The code treats them the same so they are interchangeable and they can both be used in either event definition file\&.
.br
.PP

.br
 
.SS "Derived Types:"
This describes values allowed in the 'derivedType' field of the PRESET and EVENT commands\&. It also shows the syntax of the 'eventAttr' field for each derived type supported by these commands\&. All of the derived events provide a list of one or more events which the derived event is based on (baseEvent)\&. Some derived events provide a formula that specifies how to compute the derived events value using the baseEvents in the list\&. The following derived types are supported, the syntax of the 'eventAttr' parameter for each derived event type is shown in parentheses\&.

\fBNOT_DERIVED (<baseEvent>):\fP

This derived type defines an alias for the existing event 'baseEvent'\&.

.RE
.PP
\fBDERIVED_ADD (<baseEvent1>,<baseEvent2>):\fP
.RS 4
This derived type defines a new event that will be the sum of two other events\&. It has a value of 'baseEvent1' plus 'baseEvent2'\&.
.br
 
.RE
.PP
\fBDERIVED_PS (PAPI_TOT_CYC,<baseEvent1>):\fP
.RS 4
This derived type defines a new event that will report the number of 'baseEvent1' events which occurred per second\&. It has a value of ((('baseEvent1' * cpu_max_mhz) * 1000000 ) / PAPI_TOT_CYC)\&. The user must provide PAPI_TOT_CYC as the first event of two events in the event list for this to work correctly\&.
.br
 
.RE
.PP
\fBDERIVED_ADD_PS (PAPI_TOT_CYC,<baseEvent1>,<baseEvent2>):\fP
.RS 4
This derived type defines a new event that will add together two event counters and then report the number which occurred per second\&. It has a value of (((('baseEvent1' + baseEvent2) * cpu_max_mhz) * 1000000 ) / PAPI_TOT_CYC)\&. The user must provide PAPI_TOT_CYC as the first event of three events in the event list for this to work correctly\&.

.RE
.PP
\fBDERIVED_CMPD (<baseEvent1>,<baseEvent2):\fP
.RS 4
This derived type works much like the NOT_DERIVED type\&. It is rarely used and it looks like the code just returns a single value returned from the kernel\&. There is no calculation done to compute this events value\&. Not sure why multiple input events seem to be needed to use this event type\&.
.br
 
.RE
.PP
\fBDERIVED_SUB (<baseEvent1>,<baseEvent2>):\fP
.RS 4
This derived type defines a new event that will be the difference between two other events\&. It has a value of 'baseEvent1' minus 'baseEvent2'\&.
.br
 
.RE
.PP
\fBDERIVED_POSTFIX (<pfFormula>,<baseEvent1>,<baseEvent2>, \&.\&.\&. ,<baseEventn>):\fP
.RS 4
This derived type defines a new event whose value is computed from several native events using a postfix (reverse polish notation) formula\&. Its value is the result of processing the postfix formula\&. The 'pfFormula' is of the form 'N0|N1|N2|5|*|+|-|' where the '|' acts as a token separator and the tokens N0, N1, and N2 are place holders that represent baseEvent0, baseEvent1, and baseEvent2 respectively\&.
.br
 
.RE
.PP
\fBDERIVED_INFIX (<ifFormula>,<baseEvent1>,<baseEvent2>, \&.\&.\&. ,<baseEventn>):\fP
.RS 4
This derived type defines a new event whose value is computed from several native events using an infix (algebraic notation) formula\&. Its value is the result of processing the infix formula\&. The 'ifFormula' is of the form 'N0-(N1+(N2*5))' where the tokens N0, N1, and N2 are place holders that represent baseEvent0, baseEvent1, and baseEvent2 respectively\&.

.SS "Example:"
In the following example, the events PAPI_SP_OPS, USER_SP_OPS, and ALIAS_SP_OPS will all measure the same events and return the same value\&. They just demonstrate different ways to use the PRESET and EVENT event definition commands\&.
