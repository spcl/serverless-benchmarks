.SH "Description"
.PP
papi_hybrid_native_avail is a PAPI utility program that reports information about the native events available on the current platform or on an attached MIC card\&. A native event is an event specific to a specific hardware platform\&. On many platforms, a specific native event may have a number of optional settings\&. In such cases, the native event and the valid settings are presented, rather than every possible combination of those settings\&. For each native event, a name, a description, and specific bit patterns are provided\&.
