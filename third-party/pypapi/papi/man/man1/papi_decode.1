.SH "Description"
.PP
papi_decode is a PAPI utility program that converts the PAPI presets for the existing library into a comma separated value format that can then be viewed or modified in spreadsheet applications or text editors, and can be supplied to PAPI_encode_events (3) as a way of adding or modifying event definitions for specialized applications\&. The format for the csv output consists of a line of field names, followed by a blank line, followed by one line of comma separated values for each event contained in the preset table\&. A portion of this output (for Pentium 4) is shown below:
