This document is intended to detail the features of the PAPI-V VMware component, and more specifically the installation, usage, and pseudo performance counters available. In order to make this component possible, extensive research into the actual counters available, as well as the leveraging of the VMware Guest API1, was needed. As this is the first of the PAPI-V components, we seem to be stepping into a new realm of performance measurements that, previously, has been a new frontier, or unexplored all-together. 


Installation:

To make PAPI with the VMware component you must go to the PAPI_ROOT/papi/src/components/vmware directory and configure with the flag: --with-vmware_incdir=<path>, where <path> is the path to the VMware Guest SDK for your machine.

NOTE: The VMware Guest SDK is normally found in the following default vmware-tools path: 

	/usr/lib/vmware-tools/GuestSDK

or:

	/opt/GuestSDK

	e.g.: ./configure --with-vmware_incdir=/usr/lib/vmware-tools/GuestSDK


After running configure in the vmware directory, go to PAPI_CVS_ROOT/papi/src and configure again using the flag:

	--with-components=vmware

	e.g.: ./configure --with-components=vmware

After running the main configure script you can then type make, the Makefiles have been automatically generated. If at any point you would like to uninstall PAPI and the VMware comonent, from the PAPI_ROOT/papi/src directory, just type: 

	make clean clobber

To make use of VMWare timekeeping pseudo-performance counters, the following configuration must be added through the vSphere client:

        monitor_control.pseudo_perfctr = TRUE

As well as adding the 

	--with-vmware_pseudo_perfctr
	
		WARNING: If you do not enable the monitor_control.pseudo_perfctr on the host side, and give configure the --with-vmware_pseudo_perfctr, you will get a segmentation fault upon readpmc trying to access protected memory wiothout priveledged access. This is expected behavior. 
	
flag during component configure in the vmware component directory.

Available Performance Counters:

Below is the list of available performance metrics available to PAPI through the VMware component. If at any time you would like to see a full list of counters available to PAPI type ./papi_native_avail from within the utils directory.

It is important to know that the counters VMWARE_HOST_TSC, VMWARE_ELAPSED_TIME, and VMWARE_ELAPSED_APPARENT are currently the only true to name register counters available from withing a VMware virtual machine. Any Guest OS running on a VMware host must have the access enabled from within the VMware vSphere client managing the system for each virtual machine that wishes to use the VMware component, this exposes the counters to the virtual machine. All other counters you will see in the following lost are software counters that are being exposed through the use of the VMware API1.

0x44000005 | VMWARE_CPU_SHARES  | Retrieves the number of CPU shares allocated |
           |  to the virtual machine.                                          |
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
0x44000006 | VMWARE_CPU_STOLEN  | Retrieves the number of milliseconds that th |
           | e virtual machine was in a ready state (able to transition to a r |
           | un state), but was not scheduled to run.                          |
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
0x44000007 | VMWARE_CPU_USED  | Retrieves the number of milliseconds during wh |
           | ich the virtual machine has used the CPU. This value includes the |
           |  time used by the guest operating system and the time used by vir |
           | tualization code for tasks for this virtual machine. You can comb |
           | ine this value with the elapsed time (VMWARE_ELAPSED) to estimate |
           |  the effective virtual machine CPU speed. This value is a subset  |
           | of elapsedMs.                                                     |

           |  value counts milliseconds, regardless of whether the virtual mac |
           | hine is using processing power during that time. You can combine  |
           | this value with the CPU time used by the virtual machine (VMWARE_ |

Timekeeping Counters:


        The pseudo-performance counter feature uses a trap to catch a privileged machine instruction issued by software running in the virtual machine and therefore has more overhead than reading a performance counter or the TSC on physical hardware. The feature will only trap correctly if the configuration setting is applied as described in Installation. 


The timekeeping counters behave as follows:


VMWARE_HOST_TSC - Provides access the the Time Stamp Counter on the host machine which counts ticks since reset.
VMWARE_ELAPSED_TIME - Provides access to the elapsed time in ns since reset as measured on the host machine.
VMWARE_ELAPSED_APPARENT - Apparent time is the time visible the Guest OS using virtualized timer devices. This timer may fall behind real time and catch up as needed.


Usage:


        After installation of the VMware Component, you may use the papi_commmand_line interface, found in PAPI_ROOT/papi/src/utils to read out an instantaneous value from a certain counter from the above list. If you would like to read out a counter, type: ./papi_command_line COUNTER_SYMBOL_NAME.


e.g.: To read out the value of the VMWARE_MEM_USED counter


user@vm1:~/papi/src/utils$ ./papi_command_line VMWARE_MEM_USED
Successfully added: VMWARE_MEM_USED


VMWARE_MEM_USED :         13074


----------------------------------
Verification: Checks for valid event name.
This utility lets you add events from the command line interface to see if they work.
command_line.c                       PASSED


For further usage of PAPI and it’s API on how to incorporate these counters into a program of your own please see the PAPI Documentation2.
