    What happens when several components are counting multiplexed?

/* Nils Smeds */

/* This MPX update modifies the behaviour of the multiplexing in PAPI.
 * The previous versions of the multiplexing based the value returned
 * from PAPI_reads on the total counts achieved since the PAPI_start
 * of the multiplexed event. This count was used as the basis of the
 * extrapolation using the proportion of time that this particular
 * event was active to the total time the multiplexed event was
 * active. However, a typical usage of PAPI is to measure over
 * sections of code by starting the event once and by comparing
 * the values returned by subsequent calls to PAPI_read. The difference
 * in counts is used as the measure of occured events in the code
 * section between the calls. 
 *
 * When multiplexing is used in this fashion the time proportion used
 * for extrapolation might appear inconsistent. The time fraction used
 * at each PAPI_read is the total time fraction since PAPI_start. If the
 * counter values achieved in each multiplex of the event varies
 * largely, or if the time slices are varying in length, discrepancies
 * to the behaviour without multiplexing might occur.
 *
 * In this version the extrapolation is made on a local time scale. At
 * each completed time slice the event extrapolates the achieved count
 * to a extrapolated count for the time since this event was last sliced
 * out up to the current point in time. There will still be occasions
 * when two consecutive PAPI_read will yield decreasing results, but all
 * extrapolations are being made on time local data. If time slicing
 * varies or if the count rate varies this implementation is expected to
 * be more "accurate" in a loose and here unspecified meaning.
 *
 * The short description of the changes is that the running events has
 * new fields count_estimate, rate_estimate and prev_total_c. The mpx
 * events have had the meaning of start_values and stop_values modified
 * to mean extrapolated start value and extrapolated stop value.

	 * invoking signal is blocked while the handler is active.
	 * If threads_responding == 0, the current thread caught
	 * the original timer signal.  (This thread may not have
	 * any active event lists itself, though.)  This first
	 * thread sends a signal to each of the other threads in
	 * our list of threads that have master events lists.  If
	 * threads_responding != 0, then this thread was signaled
	 * by another thread.  We decrement that value and look
	 * for an active events.  threads_responding should
	 * reach zero when all active threads have handled their
	 * signal.  It's probably possible for a thread to die
	 * before it responds to a signal; if that happens,
	 * threads_responding won't reach zero until the next
	 * timer signal happens.  Then the signalled thread won't
	 * signal any other threads.  If that happens only
	 * occasionally, there should be no harm.  Likewise if
	 * a new thread is added that fails to get signalled.
	 * As for locking, we have to lock this list to prevent
	 * another thread from modifying it, but if *this* thread
	 * is trying to update the list (from another function) and
	 * is signaled while it holds the lock, we will have deadlock.
	 * Therefore, noninterrupt functions that update *this* list
