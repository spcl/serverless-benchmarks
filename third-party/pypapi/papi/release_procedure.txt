Release Procedure for PAPI  28 Oct, 2013

Below is a step-wise procedure for making a PAPI release.
This is a living document and may not be totally current or accurate.
It is an attempt to capture current practice in making a PAPI release.
Please update it as appropriate.

One way to use this procedure is to print a copy and check off
the lines as they are completed to avoid confusion.
================================================================================
__ 0a. Notify developers that a release is imminent and the repository should be
	considered frozen. Check buildbot / make fulltest results to make sure
	the codebase is bug-free.

__ 0b. Update your local copy from git to make sure you have all changes.
	git pull

__ 1. Update any documentation that may have changed. Pay particular attention
	to INSTALL.txt.

__ 2. Check/Change the version number in: papi.spec, src/papi.h, src/configure.in, src/Makefile.in,
	doc/Doxyfile-common (PROJECT_NUMBER) ; and commit to the repo.
	Do not "git push" until autoconf is run (Step 3)
        The number may already have been updated after the last release, if so, skip this step.

-- 2a. On the icl machine gonzo:
	export PATH=/mnt/scratch/sw/doxygen-1.8.5/bin:$PATH
	-- or --
	setenv PATH /mnt/scratch/sw/doxygen-1.8.5/bin:$PATH

-- 2b. Rebuild the doxygen manpages
        ( cd doc && make && make install )
	You will want to check if anything needs to be committed to git.
	(Usually the $(papi_dir)/man/man1 and man3 directories)

-- 2c. Update the website docs... works on gonzo;
	We use Doxyfile-html for this,
	newgrp papi
	changes your defacto group to papi (starts a new shell)
	( cd doc && make clean html )
	Cleanup web dir on gonzo:/mnt/papi/docs and install new files
	Log on gonzo
	( /bin/rm -rf /mnt/papi/docs/* )
	( cp -R doc/html/* /mnt/papi/docs )
	( chmod -R 775 /mnt/papi/docs )
	Older instructions below
		rm -rf /silk/homes/icl/projectsdev/papi/docs/*
		cp -R doc/html/* /silk/homes/icl/projectsdev/papi/docs;
		chmod -R 775 /silk/homes/icl/projectsdev/papi/docs

__ 3. If configure.in is changed, run autoconf (2.59) and commit the resulting
	configure file.
	NOTE: Using an autoconf version >2.59 will work, but will produce an
	inordinate number of extraneous differences between versions.
	One possible machine with 2.59 is zoot.

__ 4. Create a ChangeLog for the current release.
	We use a python script gitlog2changelog.py to generate is for us.
	It expects the tag of the last release as an argument.
	./gitlog2changelog.py papi-a-b-c-t
	mv ChangeLog ChangeLogP4XYZ.txt

__ 5. Scan the ChangeLog to remove extraneous fluff, like perfctr imports.

__ 6. Modfy RELEASENOTES.txt to summarize the major changes listed in the log.

__ 7. Add ChangeLogXYZ.txt to git and commit both ChangeLogXYZ.txt and
	RELEASENOTES.txt.

__ 8. If this is not an incremental release, branch git.
	git checkout -b stable-X.Y [starting point eg master]

__ 9. Tag git: papi-X-Y-Z-t.
	git tag -a papi-X-Y-Z-t

__ 10. Push everything to the central repo.
	git push --tags
	-- or -- If you've created a new branch.
	git push --tags origin stable-X.Y:

__ 11. Create a fresh clone of the papi repository.
	> git clone https://icl.cs.utk.edu/git/papi.git papi-X.Y.Z
	> cd papi-X.Y.Z
       Note. If you created a new branch, check if the clone contains
       your last commit and ChangeLog.  If not, you may need to switch
       to the master, merge the branch and push.  
      ( ## if new branch ## git checkout master; git merge stable-X.Y; git push )
       
__ 12. Delete any unneccessary files or directories
		particularly .doc and .pdf files in the /doc directory
	Things needed in /doc {Doxyfile, Doxyfile-everything}
        You can use the delete_before_release.sh script for this.
	NOTE: This deletes the .git directory, don't release out of your normal
		  work directory, you will loose all the marbles this way.

__ 13. tar the directory:
	> tar -cvf papi-X.Y.Z.tar papi-X.Y.Z

__ 14. zip the tarball:
	gzip papi-X.Y.Z.tar

__ 15. Copy the tarball to /silk/homes/icl/projects/papi/downloads
       New location: gonzo:/mnt/papi/downloads

__ 16. Check permissions on the tarball. 664 is good.

__ 17. Create a link with supporting text on the PAPI software web page.

__ 18. Create a News item on the PAPI Web page.

__ 19. Email the papi developer and discussion lists with an announcement.

__ 20. Post the announcement on the PAPI User Forum.

__ 21. Bump the version number in the repository AFTER the release (look at step 2)
       papi.spec, src/papi.h, src/configure.in, src/Makefile.in, doc/Doxyfile-common (PROJECT_NUMBER) 
       Regenerate the configure using autoconf 2.59 (probably on gonzo). Then commit.
       ( git commit -m "Updated version to X.Y.Z after the release"  doc/Doxyfile-common papi.spec release_procedure.txt src/Makefile.in src/configure src/configure.in  src/papi.h )

Patch Procedure for PAPI  January 29, 2010

Below is a step-wise procedure for making a PAPI patch.

One way to use this procedure is to print a copy and check off
the lines as they are completed to avoid confusion.
================================================================================
__ 0. Make sure you're on the branch you want to patch against.
	> git branch
	* stable-5.0

__1. Generate the patch.
	> git diff -p papi-5-0-0-t stable-5.0 > papi-5-0-1.patch

__ 2. Apply the patch.
	> wget http://icl.cs.utk.edu/projects/papi/downloads/papi-5.0.0.tar.gz
	> tar xzf papi-5.0.0.tar.gz && cd papi-5.0.0
	> patch -p1 ../papi-5-0-1.patch

__ 3. If the patch applied cleanly, build and test on affected platforms;
         otherwise clean up the patch and try again.

__ 4. Copy the diff file to icl:/sw/www/icl/projects/papi/downloads/patches

__ 5. Check permissions on the diff. 644 is good.

__ 6. Create a link with supporting text on the PAPI software web page.

__ 7. Create a News item on the PAPI Web page.

__ 8. Email the papi discussion list with an announcement.

__ 9. Post the announcement on the PAPI User Forum.
