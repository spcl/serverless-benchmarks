"""Experiment implementations for serverless benchmarking.

This package provides a collection of experiment implementations for
measuring various aspects of serverless function performance:

- PerfCost: Measures performance and cost characteristics
- NetworkPingPong: Measures network latency and throughput
- EvictionModel: Measures container eviction patterns
- InvocationOverhead: Measures function invocation overhead

Each experiment is designed to evaluate specific aspects of serverless
platforms, enabling detailed comparison between different providers,
configurations, and workloads.
