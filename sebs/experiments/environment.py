"""
Manages the experiment environment, particularly CPU settings on Linux systems.

This module provides functionality to control CPU core status (online/offline),
hyperthreading, CPU boost, page cache, and CPU frequency scaling.
It is primarily designed for Intel CPUs using the intel_pstate driver.

Warning:
    This module executes commands with `sudo` and directly writes to system files
    in `/sys/devices/system/cpu/`. Use with caution and ensure necessary
    permissions are granted. Incorrect use can lead to system instability.
