"""Startup time measurement experiment implementation.

This module provides the StartupTime experiment implementation, which measures
the startup and initialization time of serverless functions. This experiment
focuses on measuring:

- Cold start initialization time
- Container startup overhead
- Runtime initialization time
- Language-specific startup costs

The experiment is designed to isolate and measure the time it takes for
a serverless platform to initialize a new container and runtime environment.
