# SeBS: Serverless Benchmark Suite

**FaaS benchmarking suite for serverless functions with automatic build, deployment, and measurements.**

![Overview of SeBS features and components.](docs/overview.png)

SeBS is a diverse suite of FaaS benchmarks that allows automatic performance analysis of
commercial and open-source serverless platforms. We provide a suite of
[benchmark applications](docs/benchmarks.md) and [experiments](docs/experiments.md)
and use them to test and evaluate different components of FaaS systems.
See the [installation instructions](#installation) to learn how to configure SeBS to use selected
commercial and open-source serverless systems.
Then, take a look at [usage instructions](docs/usage.md) to see how
SeBS can automatically launch serverless functions and entire experiments in the cloud!


SeBS provides support for **automatic deployment** and invocation of benchmarks on
commercial and black-box platforms
[AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/),
[Azure Functions](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/functions/),
and [Google Cloud Functions](https://cloud.google.com/functions).
Furthermore, we support the open-source platform [OpenWhisk](https://openwhisk.apache.org/)
and offer a custom, Docker-based local evaluation platform.
See the [documentation on cloud providers](docs/platforms.md)
for details on configuring each platform in SeBS.
The documentation describes in detail [the design and implementation of our
tool](docs/design.md), and see the [modularity](docs/modularity.md)
section to learn how SeBS can be extended with new platforms, benchmarks, and experiments.
Find out more about our project in [a paper summary](https://mcopik.github.io/projects/sebs/).

## Installation

Requirements:
- Docker (at least 19)
- Python 3.7+ with:
    - pip
    - venv
- `libcurl` and its headers must be available on your system to install `pycurl`
- Standard Linux tools and `zip` installed

... and that should be all. We currently support Linux and other POSIX systems with Bash available.
On Windows, we recommend using WSL.

To install the benchmarks with a support for all platforms, use:

```
./install.py --aws --azure --gcp --openwhisk --local
```

It will create a virtual environment in `python-venv`, and install necessary Python
dependencies and third-party dependencies. To use SeBS, you must first active the new Python
virtual environment:

```
. python-venv/bin/activate
```

Now you can deploy serverless experiments :-)

The installation of additional platforms is controlled with the `--{platform}` and `--no-{platform}`
switches. Currently, the default behavior for `install.py` is to install only the
local environment.

To verify the correctness of installation, you can use [our regression testing](docs/usage.md#regression).

> [!WARNING]
> Please do not use SeBS with `sudo`. There is no requirement to use any superuser permissions. **Make sure** that your Docker daemon is running and your user has sufficient permissions to use it (see [Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/) on configuring your user to have non-sudo access to containers). Otherwise, you might see many "Connection refused" and "Permission denied" errors when using SeBS.

> [!WARNING]
> We use libcurl to make HTTP requests. `pycurl` will attempt to build its bindings and needs headers for that - make sure you have all development packages installed. If you see an error like this one: `src/pycurl.h:206:13: fatal error: gnutls/gnutls.h: No such file or directory`, it means that you are missing some of the dependencies.
